Tobho Mott gave him a cool, careful look. “As you wish, my lord,” he said with no trace
of his former friendliness. He led Ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard, back to
the cavernous stone barn where the work was done. When the armorer opened the door,
the blast of hot air that came through made Ned feel as though he were walking into a
dragon’s mouth. Inside, a forge blazed in each corner, and the air stank of smoke and
sulfur. Journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs just long
enough to wipe the sweat from their brows, while bare-chested apprentice boys worked
the bellows.
The master called over a tall lad about Robb’s age, his arms and chest corded with
muscle. “This is Lord Stark, the new Hand of the King,” he told him as the boy looked at
Ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers. Thick
hair, shaggy and unkempt and black as ink. The shadow of a new beard darkened his
jaw. “This is Gendry. Strong for his age, and he works hard. Show the Hand that helmet
you made, lad.” Almost shyly, the boy led them to his bench, and a steel helm shaped
like a bull’s head, with two great curving horns.
Ned turned the helm over in his hands. It was raw steel, unpolished but expertly shaped.
“This is fine work. I would be pleased if you would let me buy it.”
The boy snatched it out of his hands. “It’s not for sale.”
Tobho Mott looked horror-struck. “Boy, this is the King’s Hand. If his lordship wants
this helm, make him a gift of it. He honors you by asking.”
“I made it for me,” the boy said stubbornly.
“A hundred pardons, my lord,” his master said hurriedly to Ned. “The boy is crude as
new steel, and like new steel would profit from some beating. That helm is journeyman’s
work at best. Forgive him and I promise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever
seen.”
“He’s done nothing that requires my forgiveness. Gendry, when Lord Arryn came to see
you, what did you talk about?”
“He asked me questions is all, m’lord.”
“What sort of questions?”
The boy shrugged. “How was I, and was I well treated, and if I liked the work, and stuff
about my mother. Who she was and what she looked like and all.”

“What did you tell him?” Ned asked.
The boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead. “She died when I was little. She
had yellow hair, and sometimes she used to sing to me, I remember. She worked in an
alehouse.”
“Did Lord Stannis question you as well?”
“The bald one? No, not him. He never said no word, just glared at me, like I was some
raper who done for his daughter.”
“Mind your filthy tongue,” the master said. “This is the King’s own Hand.” The boy
lowered his eyes. “A smart boy, but stubborn. That helm . . . the others call him
bullheaded, so he threw it in their teeth.”
Ned touched the boy’s head, fingering the thick black hair. “Look at me, Gendry.” The
apprentice lifted his face. Ned studied the shape of his jaw, the eyes like blue ice. Yes, he
thought, I see it. “Go back to your work, lad. I’m sorry to have bothered you.” He walked
back to the house with the master. “Who paid the boy’s apprentice fee?” he asked lightly.
Mott looked fretful. “You saw the boy. Such a strong boy. Those hands of his, those
hands were made for hammers. He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.”
“The truth now,” Ned urged. “The streets are full of strong boys. The day you take on an
apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down. Who paid for him?”
“A lord,” the master said reluctantly. “He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat.
He paid in gold, twice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and
once for my silence.”
“Describe him.”
“He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you. Brown beard, but there was a bit of
red in it, I’ll swear. He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet
worked with silver threads, but the hood shadowed his face and I never did see him
clear.” He hesitated a moment. “My lord, I want no trouble.”
“None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott,” Ned said.
“You know who the boy is.”
“I am only an armorer, my lord. I know what I’m told.”

“You know who the boy is,” Ned repeated patiently. “That is not a question.”
“The boy is my apprentice,” the master said. He looked Ned in the eye, stubborn as old
iron. “Who he was before he came to me, that’s none of my concern.”
Ned nodded. He decided that he liked Tobho Mott, master armorer. “If the day ever
comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send him to me. He has
the look of a warrior. Until then, you have my thanks, Master Mott, and my promise.
Should I ever want a helm to frighten children, this will be the first place I visit.”
His guard was waiting outside with the horses. “Did you find anything, my lord?” Jacks
asked as Ned mounted up.
“I did,” Ned told him, wondering. What had Jon Arryn wanted with a king’s bastard, and
why was it worth his life?

CATELYN
My lady, you ought cover your head,” Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north.
“You will take a chill.”
“It is only water, Ser Rodrik,” Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a loose
strand stuck to her forehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look,
but for once she did not care. The southern rain was soft and warm. Catelyn liked the
feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother’s kisses. It took her back to her childhood, to
long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered the godswood, drooping branches heavy
with moisture, and the sound of her brother’s laughter as he chased her through piles of
damp leaves. She remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud
slick and brown between her fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and
he’d eaten so much mud he was sick for a week. How young they all had been.
Catelyn had almost forgotten. In the north, the rain fell cold and hard, and sometimes at
night it turned to ice. It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it, and it sent grown men
running for the nearest shelter. That was no rain for little girls to play in.
“I am soaked through,” Ser Rodrik complained. “Even my bones are wet.” The woods
pressed close around them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied
by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud.
“We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot meal would serve us both.”
“There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,” Catelyn told him. She had slept many a
night there in her youth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless
man in his prime, always riding somewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat
woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have
an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. The sweet cakes had been
soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded those
smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha’s teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody
horror.
“An inn,” Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully. “If only . . . but we dare not risk it. If we wish to
remain unknown, I think it best we seek out some small holdfast . . . ” He broke off as
they heard sounds up the road; splashing water, the clink of mail, a horse’s whinny.
“Riders,” he warned, his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword. Even on the kingsroad, it

never hurt to be wary.
They followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them; a column of
armed men noisily fording a swollen stream. Catelyn reined up to let them pass. The
banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp, but the guardsmen
wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of Seagard. “Mallisters,”
Ser Rodrik whispered to her, as if she had not known. “My lady, best pull up your hood.”
Catelyn made no move. Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them, surrounded by his
knights, his son Patrek by his side and their squires close behind. They were riding for
King’s Landing and the Hand’s tourney, she knew. For the past week, the travelers had
been thick as flies upon the kingsroad; knights and freeriders, singers with their harps
and drums, heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of honey, traders and
craftsmen and whores, and all of them moving south.
She studied Lord Jason boldly. The last time she had seen him he had been jesting with
her uncle at her wedding feast; the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys, and his
gifts had been lavish. His brown hair was salted with white now, his face chiseled gaunt
by time, yet the years had not touched his pride. He rode like a man who feared nothing.
Catelyn envied him that; she had come to fear so much. As the riders passed, Lord Jason
nodded a curt greeting, but it was only a high lord’s courtesy to strangers chance met on
the road. There was no recognition in those fierce eyes, and his son did not even waste a
look.
“He did not know you,” Ser Rodrik said after, wondering.
“He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and tired. It would
never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord. I think
we shall be safe enough at the inn, Ser Rodrik.”
It was near dark when they reached it, at the crossroads north of the great confluence of
the Trident. Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered, still
chewing her sourleaf, but she gave them only the most cursory of looks, with nary a hint
of her ghastly red smile. “Two rooms at the top of the stair, that’s all there is,” she said,
chewing all the while. “They’re under the bell tower, you won’t be missing meals, though
there’s some thinks it too noisy. Can’t be helped. We’re full up, or near as makes no
matter. It’s those rooms or the road.”
It was those rooms, low, dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase. “Leave
your boots down here,” Masha told them after she’d taken their coin. “The boy will clean
them. I won’t have you tracking mud up my stairs. Mind the bell. Those who come late to
meals don’t eat.” There were no smiles, and no mention of sweet cakes.

When the supper bell rang, the sound was deafening. Catelyn had changed into dry
clothes. She sat by the window, watching rain run down the pane. The glass was milky
and full of bubbles, and a wet dusk was falling outside. Catelyn could just make out the
muddy crossing where the two great roads met.
The crossroads gave her pause. If they turned west from here, it was an easy ride down
to Riverrun. Her father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most, and
she yearned to talk to him, to warn him of the gathering storm. If Winterfell needed to
brace for war, how much more so Riverrun, so much closer to King’s Landing, with the
power of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a shadow. If only her father had been
stronger, she might have chanced it, but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these past two
years, and Catelyn was loath to tax him now.
The eastern road was wilder and more dangerous, climbing through rocky foothills and
thick forests into the Mountains of the Moon, past high passes and deep chasms to the
Vale of Arryn and the stony Fingers beyond. Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and
impregnable, its towers reaching for the sky. There she would find her sister . . . and,
perhaps, some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa knew more than she had dared to
put in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters
to ruin, and if it came to war, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who
owed them service.
Yet the mountain road was perilous. Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock slides were
common, and the mountain clans were lawless brigands, descending from the heights to
rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in
search of them. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord as any the Eyrie had ever known, had
always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains. Catelyn’s only strength was
one elderly knight, armored in loyalty.
No, she thought, Riverrun and the Eyrie would have to wait. Her path ran north to
Winterfell, where her sons and her duty were waiting for her. As soon as they were safely
past the Neck, she could declare herself to one of Ned’s bannermen, and send riders
racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the kingsroad.
The rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land clear
enough in her memory. The marketplace was just across the way, and the village a mile
farther on, half a hundred white cottages surrounding a small stone sept. There would be
more now; the summer had been long and peaceful. North of here the kingsroad ran
along the Green Fork of the Trident, through fertile valleys and green woodlands, past
thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords.
Catelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, whose quarrels

her father was obliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of her line, who dwelt with her ghosts
in the cavernous vaults of Harrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, who had outlived seven wives
and filled his twin castles with children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and
bastards and grandbastards as well. All of them were bannermen to the Tullys, their
swords sworn to the service of Riverrun. Catelyn wondered if that would be enough, if it
came to war. Her father was the staunchest man who’d ever lived, and she had no doubt
that he would call his banners . . . but would the banners come? The Darrys and Rygers
and Mootons had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet they had fought with Rhaegar
Targaryen on the Trident, while Lord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the
battle was over, leaving some doubt as to which army he had planned to join (theirs, he
had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her father had called
him the Late Lord Frey). It must not come to war, Catelyn thought fervently. They must
not let it.
Ser Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor. “We had best make haste if we
hope to eat tonight, my lady.”
“It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck,” she told him.
“Common travelers attract less notice. A father and daughter taken to the road on some
family business, say.”
“As you say, my lady,” Ser Rodrik agreed. It was only when she laughed that he realized
what he’d done. “The old courtesies die hard, my—my daughter.” He tried to tug on his
missing whiskers, and sighed with exasperation.
Catelyn took his arm. “Come, Father,” she said. “You’ll find that Masha Heddle sets a
good table, I think, but try not to praise her. You truly don’t want to see her smile.”
The common room was long and drafty, with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and
a fireplace at the other. A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while
Masha drew beer from the kegs, chewing her sourleaf all the while.
The benches were crowded, townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of
travelers. The crossroads made for odd companions; dyers with black and purple hands
shared a bench with rivermen reeking of fish, an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed
in beside a wizened old septon, hard-bitten sellswords and soft plump merchants
swapped news like boon companions.
The company included more swords than Catelyn would have liked. Three by the fire
wore the red stallion badge of the Brackens, and there was a large party in blue steel
ringmail and capes of a silvery grey. On their shoulder was another familiar sigil, the
twin towers of House Frey. She studied their faces, but they were all too young to have

known her. The senior among them would have been no older than Bran when she went
north.
Ser Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen. Across the table a
handsome youth was fingering a woodharp. “Seven blessings to you, goodfolk,” he said
as they sat. An empty wine cup stood on the table before him.
“And to you, singer,” Catelyn returned. Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in
a tone that meant now. The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed them boldly
and asked where they were going, and from whence they had come, and what news they
had, letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer. “We
left King’s Landing a fortnight ago,” Catelyn replied, answering the safest of his
questions.
“That’s where I’m bound,” the youth said. As she had suspected, he was more interested
in telling his own story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half so well as the
sound of their own voices. “The Hand’s tourney means rich lords with fat purses. The
last time I came away with more silver than I could carry . . . or would have, if I hadn’t
lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day.”
“The gods frown on the gambler,” Ser Rodrik said sternly. He was of the north, and
shared the Stark views on tournaments.
“They frowned on me, for certain,” the singer said. “Your cruel gods and the Knight of
Flowers altogether did me in.”
“No doubt that was a lesson for you,” Ser Rodrik said.
“It was. This time my coin will champion Ser Loras.”
Ser Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there, but before he could frame a
rebuke the serving boy came scurrying up. He laid trenchers of bread before them and
filled them with chunks of browned meat off a skewer, dripping with hot juice. Another
skewer held tiny onions, fire peppers, and fat mushrooms. Ser Rodrik set to lustily as the
lad ran back to fetch them beer.
“My name is Marillion,” the singer said, plucking a string on his woodharp. “Doubtless
you’ve heard me play somewhere?”
His manner made Catelyn smile. Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as
Winterfell, but she knew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun. “I fear not,” she told him.

He drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp. “That is your loss,” he said. “Who was the
finest singer you’ve ever heard?”
“Alia of Braavos,” Ser Rodrik answered at once.
“Oh, I’m much better than that old stick,” Marillion said. “If you have the silver for a
song, I’ll gladly show you.”
“I might have a copper or two, but I’d sooner toss it down a well than pay for your
howling,” Ser Rodrik groused. His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely
thing for girls, but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand
with a harp when he might have had a sword.
“Your grandfather has a sour nature,” Marillion said to Catelyn. “I meant to do you
honor. An homage to your beauty. In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.”
“Oh, I can see that,” Catelyn said. “Lord Tully is fond of song, I hear. No doubt you’ve
been to Riverrun.”
“A hundred times,” the singer said airily. “They keep a chamber for me, and the young
lord is like a brother.”
Catelyn smiled, wondering what Edmure would think of that. Another singer had once
bedded a girl her brother fancied; he had hated the breed ever since. “And Winterfell?”
she asked him. “Have you traveled north?”
“Why would I?’ Marillion asked. “It’s all blizzards and bearskins up there, and the Starks
know no music but the howling of wolves.” Distantly, she was aware of the door banging
open at the far end of the room.
“Innkeep,” a servant’s voice called out behind her, “we have horses that want stabling,
and my lord of Lannister requires a room and a hot bath.”
“Oh, gods,” Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him, her fingers
tightening hard around his forearm.
Masha Heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile. “I’m sorry, m’lord, truly,
we’re full up, every room.”
There were four of them, Catelyn saw. An old man in the black of the Night’s Watch, two
servants . . . and him, standing there small and bold as life. “My men will steep in your
stable, and as for myself, well, I do not require a large room, as you can plainly see.” He

flashed a mocking grin. “So long as the fire’s warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas,
I am a happy man.”
Masha Heddle was beside herself. “M’lord, there’s nothing, it’s the tourney, there’s no
help for it, oh . . . ”
Tyrion Lannister pulled a coin from his purse and flicked it up over his head, caught it,
tossed it again. Even across the room, where Catelyn sat, the wink of gold was
unmistakable.
A freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet. “You’re welcome to my room,
m’lord.”
“Now there’s a clever man,” Lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room.
The freerider snatched it from the air. “And a nimble one to boot.” The dwarf turned
back to Masha Heddle. “You will be able to manage food, I trust?”
“Anything you like, m’lord, anything at all,” the innkeep promised. And may he choke on
it, Catelyn thought, but it was Bran she saw choking, drowning on his own blood.
Lannister glanced at the nearest tables. “My men will have whatever you’re serving these
people. Double portions, we’ve had a long hard ride. I’ll take a roast fowl—chicken, duck,
pigeon, it makes no matter. And send up a flagon of your best wine. Yoren, will you sup
with me?”
“Aye, m’lord, I will,” the black brother replied.
The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was
thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly
Marillion bounded to his feet. “My lord of Lannister!” he called out. “I would be pleased
to entertain you while you eat. Let me sing you the lay of your father’s great victory at
King’s Landing!”
“Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper,” the dwarf said dryly. His mismatched
eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away . . . and found Catelyn. He
looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too late. The dwarf
was smiling. “Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,” he said. “I was sorry to miss
you at Winterfell.”
Marillion gaped at her, confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose slowly to her
feet. She heard Ser Rodrik curse. If only the man had lingered at the Wall, she thought, if
only . . .

“Lady . . . Stark?” Masha Heddle said thickly.
“I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,” she told the innkeep. She could
hear the muttering, feel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces
of the knights and sworn swords, and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of
her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no time to think it through, only the
moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. “You in the corner,” she said
to an older man she had not noticed until now. “Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see
embroidered on your surcoat, ser?”
The man got to his feet. “It is, my lady.”
“And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of
Riverrun?”
“She is,” the man replied stoutly.
Ser Rodrik rose quietly and loosened his sword in its scabbard. The dwarf was blinking
at them, blank-faced, with puzzlement in his mismatched eyes.
“The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun,” she said to the trio by the fire.
“My father counts Jonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen.”
The three men-at-arms exchanged uncertain looks. “Our lord is honored by his trust,”
one of them said hesitantly.
“I envy your father all these fine friends,” Lannister quipped, “but I do not quite see the
purpose of this, Lady Stark.”
She ignored him, turning to the large party in blue and grey. They were the heart of the
matter; there were more than twenty of them. “I know your sigil as well: the twin towers
of Frey. How fares your good lord, sers?”
Their captain rose. “Lord Walder is well, my lady. He plans to take a new wife on his
ninetieth name day, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his
presence.”
Tyrion Lannister sniggered. That was when Catelyn knew he was hers. “This man came a
guest into my house, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of seven,” she
proclaimed to the room at large, pointing. Ser Rodrik moved to her side, his sword in
hand. “In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call upon you to seize

him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king’s justice.”
She did not know what was more satisfying: the sound of a dozen swords drawn as one
or the look on Tyrion Lannister’s face.

SANSA
Sansa rode to the Hand’s tourney with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, in a litter with
curtains of yellow silk so fine she could see right through them. They turned the whole
world gold. Beyond the city walls, a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river,
and the common folk came out in the thousands to watch the games. The splendor of it
all took Sansa’s breath away; the shining armor, the great chargers caparisoned in silver
and gold, the shouts of the crowd, the banners snapping in the wind . . . and the knights
themselves, the knights most of all.
“It is better than the songs,” she whispered when they found the places that her father
had promised her, among the high lords and ladies. Sansa was dressed beautifully that
day, in a green gown that brought out the auburn of her hair, and she knew they were
looking at her and smiling.
They watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth, each more fabulous than the last.
The seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled
armor the color of milk, their cloaks as white as freshfallen snow. Ser Jaime wore the
white cloak as well, but beneath it he was shining gold from head to foot, with a lion’shead helm and a golden sword. Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides,
thundered past them like an avalanche. Sansa remembered Lord Yohn Royce, who had
guested at Winterfell two years before. “His armor is bronze, thousands and thousands
of years old, engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm,” she whispered to
Jeyne. Septa Mordane pointed out Lord Jason Mallister, in indigo chased with silver, the
wings of an eagle on his helm. He had cut down three of Rhaegar’s bannermen on the
Trident. The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr, with his flapping red
robes and shaven head, until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of
Pyke with a flaming sword in hand.
Other riders Sansa did not know; hedge knights from the Fingers and Highgarden and
the mountains of Dorne, unsung freeriders and new-made squires, the younger sons of
high lords and the heirs of lesser houses. Younger men, most had done no great deeds as
yet, but Sansa and Jeyne agreed that one day the Seven Kingdoms would resound to the
sound of their names. Ser Balon Swann. Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches. Bronze
Yohn’s heir, Ser Andar Royce, and his younger brother Ser Robar, their silvered steel
plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father. The twins
Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, whose shields displayed the grape cluster sigil of the
Redwynes, burgundy on blue. Patrek Mallister, Lord Jason’s son. Six Freys of the

Crossing: Ser Jared, Ser Hosteen, Ser Danwell, Ser Emmon, Ser Theo, Ser Perwyn, sons
and grandsons of old Lord Walder Frey, and his bastard son Martyn Rivers as well.
Jeyne Poole confessed herself frightened by the look of Jalabhar Xho, an exile prince
from the Summer Isles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark
as night, but when she saw young Lord Beric Dondarrion, with his hair like red gold and
his black shield slashed by lightning, she pronounced herself willing to marry him on the
instant.
The Hound entered the lists as well, and so too the king’s brother, handsome Lord Renly
of Storm’s End. Jory, Alyn, and Harwin rode for Winterfell and the north. “Jory looks a
beggar among these others,” Septa Mordane sniffed when he appeared. Sansa could only
agree. Jory’s armor was blue-grey plate without device or ornament, and a thin grey
cloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag. Yet he acquitted himself well, unhorsing
Horas Redwyne in his first joust and one of the Freys in his second. In his third match,
he rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his
own. Neither man lost his seat, but Brune’s lance was steadier and his blows better
placed, and the king gave him the victory. Alyn and Harwin fared less well; Harwin was
unhorsed in his first tilt by Ser Meryn of the Kingsguard, while Alyn fell to Ser Balon
Swann.
The jousting went all day and into the dusk, the hooves of the great warhorses pounding
down the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth. A dozen times Jeyne
and Sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together, lances exploding into splinters
while the commons screamed for their favorites. Jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man
fell, like a frightened little girl, but Sansa was made of sterner stuff. A great lady knew
how to behave at tournaments. Even Septa Mordane noted her composure and nodded
in approval.
The Kingslayer rode brilliantly. He overthrew Ser Andar Royce and the Marcher Lord
Bryce Caron as easily as if he were riding at rings, and then took a hard-fought match
from white-haired Barristan Selmy, who had won his first two tilts against men thirty
and forty years his junior.
Sandor Clegane and his immense brother, Ser Gregor the Mountain, seemed
unstoppable as well, riding down one foe after the next in ferocious style. The most
terrifying moment of the day came during Ser Gregor’s second joust, when his lance
rode up and struck a young knight from the Vale under the gorget with such force that it
drove through his throat, killing him instantly. The youth fell not ten feet from where
Sansa was seated. The point of Ser Gregor’s lance had snapped off in his neck, and his
life’s blood flowed out in slow pulses, each weaker than the one before. His armor was
shiny new; a bright streak of fire ran down his outstretched arm, as the steel caught the

light. Then the sun went behind a cloud, and it was gone. His cloak was blue, the color of
the sky on a clear summer’s day, trimmed with a border of crescent moons, but as his
blood seeped into it, the cloth darkened and the moons turned red, one by one.
Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her
composure, but Sansa sat with her hands folded in her lap, watching with a strange
fascination. She had never seen a man die before. She ought to be crying too, she
thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used up all her tears for Lady
and Bran. It would be different if it had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father, she told
herself. The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her, some stranger from the
Vale of Arryn whose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it. And now the world
would forget his name too, Sansa realized; there would be no songs sung for him. That
was sad.
After they carried off the body, a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt
over the spot where he had fallen, to cover up the blood. Then the jousts resumed.
Ser Balon Swann also fell to Gregor, and Lord Renly to the Hound. Renly was unhorsed
so violently that he seemed to fly backward off his charger, legs in the air. His head hit
the ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp, but it was just the golden
antler on his helm. One of the tines had snapped off beneath him. When Lord Renly
climbed to his feet, the commons cheered wildly, for King Robert’s handsome young
brother was a great favorite. He handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a gracious
bow. The Hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd, where the
commons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out
among them and restored the peace. By then Septa Mordane had returned, alone. Jeyne
had been feeling ill, she explained; she had helped her back to the castle. Sansa had
almost forgotten about Jeyne.
Later a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing Beric
Dondarrion’s horse, and was declared forfeit. Lord Beric shifted his saddle to a new
mount, only to be knocked right off it by Thoros of Myr. Ser Aron Santagar and Lothor
Brune tilted thrice without result; Ser Aron fell afterward to Lord Jason Mallister, and
Brune to Yohn Royce’s younger son, Robar.
In the end it came down to four; the Hound and his monstrous brother Gregor, Jaime
Lannister the Kingslayer, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the youth they called the Knight of
Flowers.
Ser Loras was the youngest son of Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden and Warden of
the South. At sixteen, he was the youngest rider on the field, yet he had unhorsed three
knights of the Kingsguard that morning in his first three jousts. Sansa had never seen

anyone so beautiful. His plate was intricately fashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a
thousand different flowers, and his snow-white stallion was draped in a blanket of red
and white roses. After each victory, Ser Loras would remove his helm and ride slowly
round the fence, and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss it to
some fair maiden in the crowd.
His last match of the day was against the younger Royce. Ser Robar’s ancestral runes
proved small protection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to
crash with an awful clangor in the dirt. Robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit
of the field. Finally they called for a litter and carried him off to his tent, dazed and
unmoving. Sansa never saw it. Her eyes were only for Ser Loras. When the white horse
stopped in front of her, she thought her heart would burst.
To the other maidens he had given white roses, but the one he plucked for her was red.
“Sweet lady,” he said, “no victory is half so beautiful as you.” Sansa took the flower
timidly, struck dumb by his gallantry. His hair was a mass of lazy brown curls, his eyes
like liquid gold. She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after
Ser Loras had ridden off.
When Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring. He was short, with
a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. “You must be
one of her daughters,” he said to her. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his
mouth did. “You have the Tully look.”
“I’m Sansa Stark,” she said, ill at ease. The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar,
fastened with a silver mockingbird, and he had the effortless manner of a high lord, but
she did not know him. “I have not had the honor, my lord.”
Septa Mordane quickly took a hand. “Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the king’s
small council.”
“Your mother was my queen of beauty once,” the man said quietly. His breath smelled of
mint. “You have her hair.” His fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroked one
auburn lock. Quite abruptly he turned and walked away.
By then, the moon was well up and the crowd was tired, so the king decreed that the last
three matches would be fought the next morning, before the melee. While the commons
began their walk home, talking of the day’s jousts and the matches to come on the
morrow, the court moved to the riverside to begin the feast. Six monstrous huge aurochs
had been roasting for hours, turning slowly on wooden spits while kitchen boys basted
them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit. Tables and benches had
been raised outside the pavilions, piled high with sweetgrass and strawberries and fresh-

baked bread.
Sansa and Septa Mordane were given places of high honor, to the left of the raised dais
where the king himself sat beside his queen. When Prince Joffrey seated himself to her
right, she felt her throat tighten. He had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing
had happened, and she had not dared to speak to him. At first she thought she hated him
for what they’d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept her eyes dry, she told herself that
it had not been Joffrey’s doing, not truly. The queen had done it; she was the one to hate,
her and Arya. Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya.
She could not hate Joffrey tonight. He was too beautiful to hate. He wore a deep blue
doublet studded with a double row of golden lion’s heads, and around his brow a slim
coronet made of gold and sapphires. His hair was as bright as the metal. Sansa looked at
him and trembled, afraid that he might ignore her or, worse, turn hateful again and send
her weeping from the table.
Instead Joffrey smiled and kissed her hand, handsome and gallant as any prince in the
songs, and said, “Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty, sweet lady.”
“He was too kind,” she demurred, trying to remain modest and calm, though her heart
was singing. “Ser Loras is a true knight. Do you think he will win tomorrow, my lord?”
“No,” Joffrey said. “My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few
years, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.” He raised his
hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine, and poured her a cup. She
looked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Joffrey leaned over and filled the septa’s cup as
well, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another word.
The servants kept the cups filled all night, yet afterward Sansa could not recall ever
tasting the wine. She needed no wine. She was drunk on the magic of the night, giddy
with glamour, swept away by beauties she had dreamt of all her life and never dared
hope to know. Singers sat before the king’s pavilion, filling the dusk with music. A
juggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air. The king’s own fool, the
pie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy, danced about on stilts, all in motley, making mock
of everyone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered if he was simple after all. Even
Septa Mordane was helpless before him; when he sang his little song about the High
Septon, she laughed so hard she spilled wine on herself.
And Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with
compliments, making her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon
Boy’s japes. Sansa was so captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored
Septa Mordane, seated to her left.

All the while the courses came and went. A thick soup of barley and venison. Salads of
sweetgrass and spinach and plums, sprinkled with crushed nuts. Snails in honey and
garlic. Sansa had never eaten snails before; Joffrey showed her how to get the snail out
of the shell, and fed her the first sweet morsel himself. Then came trout fresh from the
river, baked in clay; her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to expose the flaky
white flesh within. And when the meat course was brought out, he served her himself,
slicing a queen’s portion from the joint, smiling as he laid it on her plate. She could see
from the way he moved that his right arm was still troubling him, yet he uttered not a
word of complaint.
Later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and
lemon cakes frosted in sugar, but by then Sansa was so stuffed that she could not
manage more than two little lemon cakes, as much as she loved them. She was
wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king began to shout.
King Robert had grown louder with each course. From time to time Sansa could hear
him laughing or roaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and
cutlery, but they were too far away for her to make out his words.
Now everybody heard him. “No,” he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other
speech. Sansa was shocked to see the king on his feet, red of face, reeling. He had a
goblet of wine in one hand, and he was drunk as a man could be. “You do not tell me
what to do, woman,” he screamed at Queen Cersei. “I am king here, do you understand?
I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!”
Everyone was staring. Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king’s brother Renly, and the
short man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one made a move
to interfere. The queen’s face was a mask, so bloodless that it might have been sculpted
from snow. She rose from the table, gathered her skirts around her, and stormed off in
silence, servants trailing behind.
Jaime Lannister put a hand on the king’s shoulder, but the king shoved him away hard.
Lannister stumbled and fell. The king guffawed. “The great knight. I can still knock you
in the dirt. Remember that, Kingslayer.” He slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet,
splashing wine all over his satin tunic. “Give me my hammer and not a man in the realm
can stand before me!”
Jaime Lannister rose and brushed himself off. “As you say, Your Grace.” His voice was
stiff.
Lord Renly came forward, smiling. “You’ve spilled your wine, Robert. Let me bring you a
fresh goblet.”

Sansa started as Joffrey laid his hand on her arm. “It grows late,” the prince said. He had
a queer look on his face, as if he were not seeing her at all. “Do you need an escort back
to the castle?”
“No,” Sansa began. She looked for Septa Mordane, and was startled to find her with her
head on the table, snoring soft and ladylike snores. “I mean to say . . . yes, thank you,
that would be most kind. I am tired, and the way is so dark. I should be glad for some
protection.”
Joffrey called out, “Dog!”
Sandor Clegane seemed to take form out of the night, so quickly did he appear. He had
exchanged his armor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dog’s head sewn on the front.
The light of the torches made his burned face shine a dull red. “Yes, Your Grace?” he said.
“Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that no harm befalls her,” the prince told
him brusquely. And without even a word of farewell, Joffrey strode off, leaving her there.
Sansa could feel the Hound watching her. “Did you think Joff was going to take you
himself?” He laughed. He had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit. “Small chance of
that.” He pulled her unresisting to her feet. “Come, you’re not the only one needs sleep.
I’ve drunk too much, and I may need to kill my brother tomorrow.” He laughed again.
Suddenly terrified, Sansa pushed at Septa Mordane’s shoulder, hoping to wake her, but
she only snored the louder. King Robert had stumbled off and half the benches were
suddenly empty. The feast was over, and the beautiful dream had ended with it.
The Hound snatched up a torch to light their way. Sansa followed close beside him. The
ground was rocky and uneven; the flickering light made it seem to shift and move
beneath her. She kept her eyes lowered, watching where she placed her feet. They
walked among the pavilions, each with its banner and its armor hung outside, the silence
weighing heavier with every step. Sansa could not bear the sight of him, he frightened
her so, yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy. A true lady would not notice
his face, she told herself. “You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,” she made herself say.
Sandor Clegane snarled at her. “Spare me your empty little compliments, girl . . . and
your ser’s. I am no knight. I spit on them and their vows. My brother is a knight. Did you
see him ride today?”
“Yes,” Sansa whispered, trembling. “He was . . .

“Gallant?” the Hound finished.
He was mocking her, she realized. “No one could withstand him,” she managed at last,
proud of herself. It was no lie.
Sandor Clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field. She had no
choice but to stop beside him. “Some septa trained you well. You’re like one of those
birds from the Summer Isles, aren’t you? A pretty little talking bird, repeating all the
pretty little words they taught you to recite.”
“That’s unkind.” Sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest. “You’re frightening
me. I want to go now.”
“No one could withstand him,” the Hound rasped. “That’s truth enough. No one could
ever withstand Gregor. That boy today, his second joust, oh, that was a pretty bit of
business. You saw that, did you? Fool boy, he had no business riding in this company.
No money, no squire, no one to help him with that armor. That gorget wasn’t fastened
proper. You think Gregor didn’t notice that? You think Ser Gregor’s lance rode up by
chance, do you? Pretty little talking girl, you believe that, you’re empty-headed as a bird
for true. Gregor’s lance goes where Gregor wants it to go. Look at me. Look at me!”
Sandor Clegane put a huge hand under her chin and forced her face up. He squatted in
front of her, and moved the torch close. “There’s a pretty for you. Take a good long stare.
You know you want to. I’ve watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad.
Piss on that. Take your look.”
His fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap. His eyes watched hers. Drunken eyes,
sullen with anger. She had to look.
The right side of his face was gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a
heavy brow. His nose was large and hooked, his hair thin, dark. He wore it long and
brushed it sideways, because no hair grew on the other side of that face.
The left side of his face was a ruin. His ear had been burned away; there was nothing left
but a hole. His eye was still good, but all around it was a twisted mass of scar, slick black
flesh hard as leather, pocked with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red
and wet when he moved. Down by his jaw, you could see a hint of bone where the flesh
had been seared away.
Sansa began to cry. He let go of her then, and snuffed out the torch in the dirt. “No
pretty words for that, girl? No little compliment the septa taught you?” When there was
no answer, he continued. “Most of them, they think it was some battle. A siege, a
burning tower, an enemy with a torch. One fool asked if it was dragonsbreath.” His laugh

was softer this time, but just as bitter. “I’ll tell you what it was, girl,” he said, a voice from
the night, a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine on
his breath. “I was younger than you, six, maybe seven. A woodcarver set up shop in the
village under my father’s keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made
marvelous toys. I don’t remember what I got, but it was Gregor’s gift I wanted. A wooden
knight, all painted up, every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings, so you could
make him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy was nothing to him, he was
already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his knight, but there
was no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me.
There was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his
arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I
screamed and screamed. You saw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown men
to drag him off me. The septons preach about the seven hells. What do they know? Only
a man who’s been burned knows what hell is truly like.
“My father told everyone my bedding had caught fire, and our maester gave me
ointments. Ointments! Gregor got his ointments too. Four years later, they anointed him
with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him
on the shoulder and said, ‘Arise, Ser Gregor.’ ”
The rasping voice trailed off. He squatted silently before her, a hulking black shape
shrouded in the night, hidden from her eyes. Sansa could hear his ragged breathing. She
was sad for him, she realized. Somehow, the fear had gone away.
The silence went on and on, so long that she began to grow afraid once more, but she
was afraid for him now, not for herself. She found his massive shoulder with her hand.
“He was no true knight,” she whispered to him.
The Hound threw back his head and roared. Sansa stumbled back, away from him, but
he caught her arm. “No,” he growled at her, “no, little bird, he was no true knight.”
The rest of the way into the city, Sandor Clegane said not a word. He led her to where the
carts were waiting, told a driver to take them back to the Red Keep, and climbed in after
her. They rode in silence through the King’s Gate and up torchlit city streets. He opened
the postern door and led her into the castle, his burned face twitching and his eyes
brooding, and he was one step behind her as they climbed the tower stairs. He took her
safe all the way to the corridor outside her bedchamber.
“Thank you, my lord,” Sansa said meekly.
The Hound caught her by the arm and leaned close. “The things I told you tonight,” he
said, his voice sounding even rougher than usual. “If you ever tell Joffrey . . . your sister,

your father . . . any of them . . . ”
“I won’t,” Sansa whispered. “I promise.”
It was not enough. “If you ever tell anyone,” he finished, “I’ll kill you.”

EDDARD
I stood last vigil for him myself,” Ser Barristan Selmy said as they looked down at the
body in the back of the cart. “He had no one else. A mother in the Vale, I am told.”
In the pale dawn light, the young knight looked as though he were sleeping. He had not
been handsome, but death had smoothed his rough-hewn features and the silent sisters
had dressed him in his best velvet tunic, with a high collar to cover the ruin the lance
had made of his throat. Eddard Stark looked at his face, and wondered if it had been for
his sake that the boy had died. Slain by a Lannister bannerman before Ned could speak
to him; could that be mere happenstance? He supposed he would never know.
“Hugh was Jon Arryn’s squire for four years,” Selmy went on. “The king knighted him
before he rode north, in Jon’s memory. The lad wanted it desperately, yet I fear he was
not ready.”
Ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years. “None of us is ever
ready,” he said.
“For knighthood?”
“For death.” Gently Ned covered the boy with his cloak, a bloodstained bit of blue
bordered in crescent moons. When his mother asked why her son was dead, he reflected
bitterly, they would tell her he had fought to honor the King’s Hand, Eddard Stark. “This
was needless. War should not be a game.” Ned turned to the woman beside the cart,
shrouded in grey, face hidden but for her eyes. The silent sisters prepared men for the
grave, and it was ill fortune to look on the face of death. “Send his armor home to the
Vale. The mother will want to have it.”
“It is worth a fair piece of silver,” Ser Barristan said. “The boy had it forged special for
the tourney. Plain work, but good. I do not know if he had finished paying the smith.”
“He paid yesterday, my lord, and he paid dearly,” Ned replied. And to the silent sister he
said, “Send the mother the armor. I will deal with this smith.” She bowed her head.
Afterward Ser Barristan walked with Ned to the king’s pavilion. The camp was beginning
to stir. Fat sausages sizzled and spit over firepits, spicing the air with the scents of garlic

and pepper. Young squires hurried about on errands as their masters woke, yawning and
stretching, to meet the day. A serving man with a goose under his arm bent his knee
when he caught sight of them. “M’lords,” he muttered as the goose honked and pecked at
his fingers. The shields displayed outside each tent heralded its occupant: the silver
eagle of Seagard, Bryce Caron’s field of nightingales, a cluster of grapes for the
Redwynes, brindled boar, red ox, burning tree, white ram, triple spiral, purple unicorn,
dancing maiden, blackadder, twin towers, horned owl, and last the pure white blazons of
the Kingsguard, shining like the dawn.
“The king means to fight in the melee today,” Ser Barristan said as they were passing Ser
Meryn’s shield, its paint sullied by a deep gash where Loras Tyrell’s lance had scarred
the wood as he drove him from his saddle.
“Yes,” Ned said grimly. Jory had woken him last night to bring him that news. Small
wonder he had slept so badly.
Ser Barristan’s look was troubled. “They say night’s beauties fade at dawn, and the
children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light.”
“They say so,” Ned agreed, “but not of Robert.” Other men might reconsider words
spoken in drunken bravado, but Robert Baratheon would remember and, remembering,
would never back down.
The king’s pavilion was close by the water, and the morning mists off the river had
wreathed it in wisps of grey. It was all of golden silk, the largest and grandest structure
in the camp. Outside the entrance, Robert’s warhammer was displayed beside an
immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of House Baratheon.
Ned had hoped to discover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep, but luck was not
with him. They found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his
displeasure at two young squires who were trying to buckle him into his armor. “Your
Grace,” one was saying, almost in tears, “it’s made too small, it won’t go.” He fumbled,
and the gorget he was trying to fit around Robert’s thick neck tumbled to the ground.
“Seven hells!” Robert swore. “Do I have to do it myself? Piss on the both of you. Pick it
up. Don’t just stand there gaping, Lancel, pick it up!” The lad jumped, and the king
noticed his company. “Look at these oafs, Ned. My wife insisted I take these two to
squire for me, and they’re worse than useless. Can’t even put a man’s armor on him
properly. Squires, they say. I say they’re swineherds dressed up in silk.”
Ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty. “The boys are not at fault,” he told
the king. “You’re too fat for your armor, Robert.”

Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer, tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping
furs, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and said darkly, “Fat? Fat, is it? Is that
how you speak to your king?” He let go his laughter, sudden as a storm. “Ah, damn you,
Ned, why are you always right?”
The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them. “You. Yes, both of you. You
heard the Hand. The king is too fat for his armor. Go find Ser Aron Santagar. Tell him I
need the breastplate stretcher. Now! What are you waiting for?”
The boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the tent. Robert managed to
keep a stern face until they were gone. Then he dropped back into a chair, shaking with
laughter.
Ser Barristan Selmy chuckled with him. Even Eddard Stark managed a smile. Always,
though, the graver thoughts crept in. He could not help taking note of the two squires:
handsome boys, fair and well made. One was Sansa’s age, with long golden curls; the
other perhaps fifteen, sandy-haired, with a wisp of a mustache and the emerald-green
eyes of the queen.
“Ah, I wish I could be there to see Santagar’s face,” Robert said. “I hope he’ll have the wit
to send them to someone else. We ought to keep them running all day!”
“Those boys,” Ned asked him. “Lannisters?”
Robert nodded, wiping tears from his eyes. “Cousins. Sons of Lord Tywin’s brother. One
of the dead ones. Or perhaps the live one, now that I come to think on it. I don’t recall.
My wife comes from a very large family, Ned.”
A very ambitious family, Ned thought. He had nothing against the squires, but it
troubled him to see Robert surrounded by the queen’s kin, waking and sleeping. The
Lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know no bounds. “The talk is you
and the queen had angry words last night.”
The mirth curdled on Robert’s face. “The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee.
She’s sulking in the castle now, damn her. Your sister would never have shamed me like
that.”
“You never knew Lyanna as I did, Robert,” Ned told him. “You saw her beauty, but not
the iron underneath. She would have told you that you have no business in the melee.”
“You too?” The king frowned. “You are a sour man, Stark. Too long in the north, all the

juices have frozen inside you. Well, mine are still running.” He slapped his chest to prove
it.
“You are the king,” Ned reminded him.
“I sit on the damn iron seat when I must. Does that mean I don’t have the same hungers
as other men? A bit of wine now and again, a girl squealing in bed, the feel of a horse
between my legs? Seven hells, Ned, I want to hit someone.”
Ser Barristan Selmy spoke up. “Your Grace,” he said, “it is not seemly that the king
should ride into the melee. It would not be a fair contest. Who would dare strike you?”
Robert seemed honestly taken aback. “Why, all of them, damn it. If they can. And the
last man left standing . . . ”
“ . . . will be you,” Ned finished. He saw at once that Selmy had hit the mark. The dangers
of the melee were only a savor to Robert, but this touched on his pride. “Ser Barristan is
right. There’s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by
hurting you.”
The king rose to his feet, his face flushed. “Are you telling me those prancing cravens will
let me win?”
“For a certainty,” Ned said, and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed his head in silent accord.
For a moment Robert was so angry he could not speak. He strode across the tent,
whirled, strode back, his face dark and angry. He snatched up his breastplate from the
ground and threw it at Barristan Selmy in a wordless fury. Selmy dodged. “Get out,” the
king said then, coldly. “Get out before I kill you.”
Ser Barristan left quickly. Ned was about to follow when the king called out again. “Not
you, Ned.”
Ned turned back. Robert took up his horn again, filled it with beer from a barrel in the
corner, and thrust it at Ned. “Drink,” he said brusquely.
“I’ve no thirst—”
“Drink. Your king commands it.”
Ned took the horn and drank. The beer was black and thick, so strong it stung the eyes.

Robert sat down again. “Damn you, Ned Stark. You and Jon Arryn, I loved you both.
What have you done to me? You were the one should have been king, you or Jon.”
“You had the better claim, Your Grace.”
“I told you to drink, not to argue. You made me king, you could at least have the courtesy
to listen when I talk, damn you. Look at me, Ned. Look at what kinging has done to me.
Gods, too fat for my armor, how did it ever come to this?”
“Robert . . . ”
“Drink and stay quiet, the king is talking. I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I
was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I’ve won it. And Cersei . . . I have Jon
Arryn to thank for her. I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me, but Jon
said the realm needed an heir. Cersei Lannister would be a good match, he told me, she
would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father’s
throne.” The king shook his head. “I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he
was a bigger fool than Moon Boy. Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but cold . . . the
way she guards her cunt, you’d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her
legs. Here, give me that beer if you won’t drink it.” He took the horn, upended it,
belched, wiped his mouth. “I am sorry for your girl, Ned. Truly. About the wolf, I mean.
My son was lying, I’d stake my soul on it. My son . . . you love your children, don’t you?”
“With all my heart,” Ned said.
“Let me tell you a secret, Ned. More than once, I have dreamed of giving up the crown.
Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer, spend my time warring and
whoring, that’s what I was made for. The sellsword king, how the singers would love me.
You know what stops me? The thought of Joffrey on the throne, with Cersei standing
behind him whispering in his ear. My son. How could I have made a son like that, Ned?”
“He’s only a boy,” Ned said awkwardly. He had small liking for Prince Joffrey, but he
could hear the pain in Robert’s voice. “Have you forgotten how wild you were at his age?”
“It would not trouble me if the boy was wild, Ned. You don’t know him as I do.” He
sighed and shook his head. “Ah, perhaps you are right. Jon despaired of me often
enough, yet I grew into a good king.” Robert looked at Ned and scowled at his silence.
“You might speak up and agree now, you know.”
“Your Grace . . . ” Ned began, carefully.

Robert slapped Ned on the back. “Ah, say that I’m a better king than Aerys and be done
with it. You never could lie for love nor honor, Ned Stark. I’m still young, and now that
you’re here with me, things will be different. We’ll make this a reign to sing of, and damn
the Lannisters to seven hells. I smell bacon. Who do you think our champion will be
today? Have you seen Mace Tyrell’s boy? The Knight of Flowers, they call him. Now
there’s a son any man would be proud to own to. Last tourney, he dumped the
Kingslayer on his golden rump, you ought to have seen the look on Cersei’s face. I
laughed till my sides hurt. Renly says he has this sister, a maid of fourteen, lovely as a
dawn . . . ”
They broke their fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up with onions
and bacon, at a trestle table by the river’s edge. The king’s melancholy melted away with
the morning mist, and before long Robert was eating an orange and waxing fond about a
morning at the Eyrie when they had been boys. “ . . . had given Jon a barrel of oranges,
remember? Only the things had gone rotten, so I flung mine across the table and hit
Dacks right in the nose. You remember, Redfort’s pock-faced squire? He tossed one back
at me, and before Jon could so much as fart, there were oranges flying across the High
Hall in every direction.” He laughed uproariously, and even Ned smiled, remembering.
This was the boy he had grown up with, he thought; this was the Robert Baratheon he’d
known and loved. If he could prove that the Lannisters were behind the attack on Bran,
prove that they had murdered Jon Arryn, this man would listen. Then Cersei would fall,
and the Kingslayer with her, and if Lord Tywin dared to rouse the west, Robert would
smash him as he had smashed Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident. He could see it all so
clearly.
That breakfast tasted better than anything Eddard Stark had eaten in a long time, and
afterward his smiles came easier and more often, until it was time for the tournament to
resume.
Ned walked with the king to the jousting field. He had promised to watch the final tilts
with Sansa; Septa Mordane was ill today, and his daughter was determined not to miss
the end of the jousting. As he saw Robert to his place, he noted that Cersei Lannister had
chosen not to appear; the place beside the king was empty. That too gave Ned cause to
hope.
He shouldered his way to where his daughter was seated and found her as the horns
blew for the day’s first joust. Sansa was so engrossed she scarcely seemed to notice his
arrival.
Sandor Clegane was the first rider to appear. He wore an olive- green cloak over his sootgrey armor. That, and his hound’s-head helm, were his only concession to ornament.

“A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer,” Littlefinger announced loudly as Jaime
Lannister entered the lists, riding an elegant blood bay destrier. The horse wore a
blanket of gilded ringmail, and Jaime glittered from head to heel. Even his lance was
fashioned from the golden wood of the Summer Isles.
“Done,” Lord Renly shouted back. “The Hound has a hungry look about him this
morning.”
“Even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them,” Littlefinger called
dryly.
Sandor Clegane dropped his visor with an audible clang and took up his position. Ser
Jaime tossed a kiss to some woman in the commons, gently lowered his visor, and rode
to the end of the lists. Both men couched their lances.
Ned Stark would have loved nothing so well as to see them both lose, but Sansa was
watching it all moist-eyed and eager. The hastily erected gallery trembled as the horses
broke into a gallop. The Hound leaned forward as he rode, his lance rock steady, but
Jaime shifted his seat deftly in the instant before impact. Clegane’s point was turned
harmlessly against the golden shield with the lion blazon, while his own hit square.
Wood shattered, and the Hound reeled, fighting to keep his seat. Sansa gasped. A ragged
cheer went up from the commons.
“I wonder how I ought spend your money,” Littlefinger called down to Lord Renly.
The Hound just managed to stay in his saddle. He jerked his mount around hard and
rode back to the lists for the second pass. Jaime Lannister tossed down his broken lance
and snatched up a fresh one, jesting with his squire. The Hound spurred forward at a
hard gallop. Lannister rode to meet him. This time, when Jaime shifted his seat, Sandor
Clegane shifted with him. Both lances exploded, and by the time the splinters had
settled, a riderless blood bay was trotting off in search of grass while Ser Jaime Lannister
rolled in the dirt, golden and dented.
Sansa said, “I knew the Hound would win.”
Littlefinger overheard. “If you know who’s going to win the second match, speak up now
before Lord Renly plucks me clean,” he called to her. Ned smiled.
“A pity the Imp is not here with us,” Lord Renly said. “I should have won twice as much.”
Jaime Lannister was back on his feet, but his ornate lion helmet had been twisted

around and dented in his fall, and now he could not get it off. The commons were
hooting and pointing, the lords and ladies were trying to stifle their chuckles, and failing,
and over it all Ned could hear King Robert laughing, louder than anyone. Finally they
had to lead the Lion of Lannister off to a blacksmith, blind and stumbling.
By then Ser Gregor Clegane was in position at the head of the lists. He was huge, the
biggest man that Eddard Stark had ever seen. Robert Baratheon and his brothers were
all big men, as was the Hound, and back at Winterfell there was a simpleminded
stableboy named Hodor who dwarfed them all, but the knight they called the Mountain
That Rides would have towered over Hodor. He was well over seven feet tall, closer to
eight, with massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunks of small trees. His destrier
seemed a pony in between his armored legs, and the lance he carried looked as small as a
broom handle.
Unlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court. He was a solitary man who seldom
left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys. He had been with Lord Tywin when King’s
Landing fell, a new-made knight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by his size
and his implacable ferocity. Some said it had been Gregor who’d dashed the skull of the
infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and whispered that afterward he had
raped the mother, the Dornish princess Elia, before putting her to the sword. These
things were not said in Gregor’s hearing.
Ned Stark could not recall ever speaking to the man, though Gregor had ridden with
them during Balon Greyjoy’s rebellion, one knight among thousands. He watched him
with disquiet. Ned seldom put much stock in gossip, but the things said of Ser Gregor
were more than ominous. He was soon to be married for the third time, and one heard
dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives. It was said that his keep was a
grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and even the dogs were afraid to
enter the hall. And there had been a sister who had died young under queer
circumstances, and the fire that had disfigured his brother, and the hunting accident
that had killed their father. Gregor had inherited the keep, the gold, and the family
estates. His younger brother Sandor had left the same day to take service with the
Lannisters as a sworn sword, and it was said that he had never returned, not even to visit.
When the Knight of Flowers made his entrance, a murmur ran through the crowd, and
he heard Sansa’s fervent whisper, “Oh, he’s so beautiful.” Ser Loras Tyrell was slender as
a reed, dressed in a suit of fabulous silver armor polished to a blinding sheen and
filigreed with twining black vines and tiny blue forget-me-nots. The commons realized in
the same instant as Ned that the blue of the flowers came from sapphires; a gasp went
up from a thousand throats. Across the boy’s shoulders his cloak hung heavy. It was
woven of forget-me-nots, real ones, hundreds of fresh blooms sewn to a heavy woolen
cape.

His courser was as slim as her rider, a beautiful grey mare, built for speed. Ser Gregor’s
huge stallion trumpeted as he caught her scent. The boy from Highgarden did something
with his legs, and his horse pranced sideways, nimble as a dancer. Sansa clutched at his
arm. “Father, don’t let Ser Gregor hurt him,” she said. Ned saw she was wearing the rose
that Ser Loras had given her yesterday. Jory had told him about that as well.
“These are tourney lances,” he told his daughter. “They make them to splinter on impact,
so no one is hurt.” Yet he remembered the dead boy in the cart with his cloak of crescent
moons, and the words were raw in his throat.
Ser Gregor was having trouble controlling his horse. The stallion was screaming and
pawing the ground, shaking his head. The Mountain kicked at the animal savagely with
an armored boot. The horse reared and almost threw him.
The Knight of Flowers saluted the king, rode to the far end of the list, and couched his
lance, ready. Ser Gregor brought his animal to the line, fighting with the reins. And
suddenly it began. The Mountain’s stallion broke in a hard gallop, plunging forward
wildly, while the mare charged as smooth as a flow of silk. Ser Gregor wrenched his
shield into position, juggled with his lance, and all the while fought to hold his unruly
mount on a straight line, and suddenly Loras Tyrell was on him, placing the point of his
lance just there, and in an eye blink the Mountain was failing. He was so huge that he
took his horse down with him in a tangle of steel and flesh.
Ned heard applause, cheers, whistles, shocked gasps, excited muttering, and over it all
the rasping, raucous laughter of the Hound. The Knight of Flowers reined up at the end
of the lists. His lance was not even broken. His sapphires winked in the sun as he raised
his visor, smiling. The commons went mad for him.
In the middle of the field, Ser Gregor Clegane disentangled himself and came boiling to
his feet. He wrenched off his helm and slammed it down onto the ground. His face was
dark with fury and his hair fell down into his eyes. “My sword,” he shouted to his squire,
and the boy ran it out to him. By then his stallion was back on its feet as well.
Gregor Clegane killed the horse with a single blow of such ferocity that it half severed the
animal’s neck. Cheers turned to shrieks in a heartbeat. The stallion went to its knees,
screaming as it died. By then Gregor was striding down the lists toward Ser Loras Tyrell,
his bloody sword clutched in his fist. “Stop him!” Ned shouted, but his words were lost in
the roar. Everyone else was yelling as well, and Sansa was crying.
It all happened so fast. The Knight of Flowers was shouting for his own sword as Ser
Gregor knocked his squire aside and made a grab for the reins of his horse. The mare
scented blood and reared. Loras Tyrell kept his seat, but barely. Ser Gregor swung his

sword, a savage two-handed blow that took the boy in the chest and knocked him from
the saddle. The courser dashed away in panic as Ser Loras lay stunned in the dirt. But as
Gregor lifted his sword for the killing blow, a rasping voice warned, “Leave him be,” and
a steel-clad hand wrenched him away from the boy.
The Mountain pivoted in wordless fury, swinging his longsword in a killing arc with all
his massive strength behind it, but the Hound caught the blow and turned it, and for
what seemed an eternity the two brothers stood hammering at each other as a dazed
Loras Tyrell was helped to safety. Thrice Ned saw Ser Gregor aim savage blows at the
hound’s-head helmet, yet not once did Sandor send a cut at his brother’s unprotected
face.
It was the king’s voice that put an end to it . . . the king’s voice and twenty swords. Jon
Arryn had told them that a commander needs a good battlefield voice, and Robert had
proved the truth of that on the Trident. He used that voice now. “STOP THIS
MADNESS,” he boomed, “IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!”
The Hound went to one knee. Ser Gregor’s blow cut air, and at last he came to his senses.
He dropped his sword and glared at Robert, surrounded by his Kingsguard and a dozen
other knights and guardsmen. Wordlessly, he turned and strode off, shoving past
Barristan Selmy. “Let him go,” Robert said, and as quickly as that, it was over.
“Is the Hound the champion now?” Sansa asked Ned.
“No,” he told her. “There will be one final joust, between the Hound and the Knight of
Flowers.”
But Sansa had the right of it after all. A few moments later Ser Loras Tyrell walked back
onto the field in a simple linen doublet and said to Sandor Clegane, “I owe you my life.
The day is yours, ser.”
“I am no ser,” the Hound replied, but he took the victory, and the champion’s purse,
and, for perhaps the first time in his life, the love of the commons. They cheered him as
he left the lists to return to his pavilion.
As Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field, Littlefinger and Lord Renly and some of
the others fell in with them. “Tyrell had to know the mare was in heat,” Littlefinger was
saying. “I swear the boy planned the whole thing. Gregor has always favored huge, illtempered stallions with more spirit than sense.” The notion seemed to amuse him.
It did not amuse Ser Barristan Selmy. “There is small honor in tricks,” the old man said
stiffly.

“Small honor and twenty thousand golds.” Lord Renly smiled.
That afternoon a boy named Anguy, an unheralded commoner from the Dornish
Marches, won the archery competition, outshooting Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho
at a hundred paces after all the other bowmen had been eliminated at the shorter
distances. Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with the Hand’s guard,
but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of, and he refused.
The melee went on for three hours. Near forty men took part, freeriders and hedge
knights and new-made squires in search of a reputation. They fought with blunted
weapons in a chaos of mud and blood, small troops fighting together and then turning
on each other as alliances formed and fractured, until only one man was left standing.
The victor was the red priest, Thoros of Myr, a madman who shaved his head and fought
with a flaming sword. He had won melees before; the fire sword frightened the mounts
of the other riders, and nothing frightened Thoros. The final tally was three broken
limbs, a shattered collarbone, a dozen smashed fingers, two horses that had to be put
down, and more cuts, sprains, and bruises than anyone cared to count. Ned was
desperately pleased that Robert had not taken part.
That night at the feast, Eddard Stark was more hopeful than he had been in a great
while. Robert was in high good humor, the Lannisters were nowhere to be seen, and
even his daughters were behaving. Jory brought Arya down to join them, and Sansa
spoke to her sister pleasantly. “The tournament was magnificent,” she sighed. “You
should have come. How was your dancing?”
“I’m sore all over,” Arya reported happily, proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on
her leg.
“You must be a terrible dancer,” Sansa said doubtfully.
Later, while Sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the complex round of
interwoven ballads called the “Dance of the Dragons,” Ned inspected the bruise himself.
“I hope Forel is not being too hard on you,” he said.
Arya stood on one leg. She was getting much better at that of late. “Syrio says that every
hurt is a lesson, and every lesson makes you better.”
Ned frowned. The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and his
flamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya’s slender blade, yet still . . . a few days
ago, she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes. Syrio
was teaching her to see with her ears and her nose and her skin, she told him. Before

that, he had her doing spins and back flips. “Arya, are you certain you want to persist in
this?”
She nodded. “Tomorrow we’re going to catch cats.”
“Cats.” Ned sighed. “Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi. If you like, I will ask
Jory to take over your lessons. Or I might have a quiet word with Ser Barristan. He was
the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in his youth.”
“I don’t want them,” Arya said. “I want Syrio.”
Ned ran his fingers through his hair. Any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the
rudiments of slash-and-parry without this nonsense of blindfolds, cartwheels, and
hopping about on one leg, but he knew his youngest daughter well enough to know there
was no arguing with that stubborn jut of jaw. “As you wish,” he said. Surely she would
grow tired of this soon. “Try to be careful.”
“I will,” she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to her left.
Much later, after he had taken the girls back through the city and seen them both safe in
bed, Sansa with her dreams and Arya with her bruises, Ned ascended to his own
chambers atop the Tower of the Hand. The day had been warm and the room was close
and stuffy. Ned went to the window and unfastened the heavy shutters to let in the cool
night air. Across the Great Yard, he noticed the flickering glow of candlelight from
Littlefinger’s windows. The hour was well past midnight. Down by the river, the revels
were only now beginning to dwindle and die.
He took out the dagger and studied it. Littlefinger’s blade, won by Tyrion Lannister in a
tourney wager, sent to slay Bran in his sleep. Why? Why would the dwarf want Bran
dead? Why would anyone want Bran dead?
The dagger, Bran’s fall, all of it was linked somehow to the murder of Jon Arryn, he
could feel it in his gut, but the truth of Jon’s death remained as clouded to him as when
he had started. Lord Stannis had not returned to King’s Landing for the tourney. Lysa
Arryn held her silence behind the high walls of the Eyrie. The squire was dead, and Jory
was still searching the whorehouses. What did he have but Robert’s bastard?
That the armorer’s sullen apprentice was the king’s son, Ned had no doubt. The
Baratheon look was stamped on his face, in his jaw, his eyes, that black hair. Renly was
too young to have fathered a boy of that age, Stannis too cold and proud in his honor.
Gendry had to be Robert’s.

Yet knowing all that, what had he learned? The king had other baseborn children
scattered throughout the Seven Kingdoms. He had openly acknowledged one of his
bastards, a boy of Bran’s age whose mother was highborn. The lad was being fostered by
Lord Renly’s castellan at Storm’s End.
Ned remembered Robert’s first child as well, a daughter born in the Vale when Robert
was scarcely more than a boy himself. A sweet little girl; the young lord of Storm’s End
had doted on her. He used to make daily visits to play with the babe, long after he had
lost interest in the mother. Ned was often dragged along for company, whether he willed
it or not. The girl would be seventeen or eighteen now, he realized; older than Robert
had been when he fathered her. A strange thought.
Cersei could not have been pleased by her lord husband’s by-blows, yet in the end it
mattered little whether the king had one bastard or a hundred. Law and custom gave the
baseborn few rights. Gendry, the girl in the Vale, the boy at Storm’s End, none of them
could threaten Robert’s trueborn children . . .
His musings were ended by a soft rap on his door. “A man to see you, my lord,” Harwin
called. “He will not give his name.”
“Send him in,” Ned said, wondering.
The visitor was a stout man in cracked, mud-caked boots and a heavy brown robe of the
coarsest roughspun, his features hidden by a cowl, his hands drawn up into voluminous
sleeves.
“Who are you?” Ned asked.
“A friend,” the cowled man said in a strange, low voice. “We must speak alone, Lord
Stark.”
Curiosity was stronger than caution. “Harwin, leave us,” he commanded. Not until they
were alone behind closed doors did his visitor draw back his cowl.
“Lord Varys?” Ned said in astonishment.
“Lord Stark,” Varys said politely, seating himself. “I wonder if I might trouble you for a
drink?”
Ned filled two cups with summerwine and handed one to Varys. “I might have passed
within a foot of you and never recognized you,” he said, incredulous. He had never seen
the eunuch dress in anything but silk and velvet and the richest damasks, and this man

smelled of sweat instead of lilacs.
“That was my dearest hope,” Varys said. “It would not do if certain people learned that
we had spoken in private. The queen watches you closely. This wine is very choice.
Thank you.”
“How did you get past my other guards?” Ned asked. Porther and Cayn had been posted
outside the tower, and Alyn on the stairs.
“The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders.” Varys smiled apologetically.
“I will not keep you long, my lord. There are things you must know. You are the King’s
Hand, and the king is a fool.” The eunuch’s cloying tones were gone; now his voice was
thin and sharp as a whip. “Your friend, I know, yet a fool nonetheless . . . and doomed,
unless you save him. Today was a near thing. They had hoped to kill him during the
melee.”
For a moment Ned was speechless with shock. “Who?”
Varys sipped his wine. “If I truly need to tell you that, you are a bigger fool than Robert
and I am on the wrong side.”
“The Lannisters,” Ned said. “The queen . . . no, I will not believe that, not even of Cersei.
She asked him not to fight!”
“She forbade him to fight, in front of his brother, his knights, and half the court. Tell me
truly, do you know any surer way to force King Robert into the melee? I ask you.”
Ned had a sick feeling in his gut. The eunuch had hit upon a truth; tell Robert Baratheon
he could not, should not, or must not do a thing, and it was as good as done. “Even if
he’d fought, who would have dared to strike the king?”
Varys shrugged. “There were forty riders in the melee. The Lannisters have many
friends. Amidst all that chaos, with horses screaming and bones breaking and Thoros of
Myr waving that absurd firesword of his, who could name it murder if some chance blow
felled His Grace?” He went to the flagon and refilled his cup. “After the deed was done,
the slayer would be beside himself with grief. I can almost hear him weeping. So sad. Yet
no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity, lift the poor
unfortunate to his feet, and bless him with a gentle kiss of forgiveness. Good King
Joffrey would have no choice but to pardon him.” The eunuch stroked his cheek. “Or
perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike off his head. Less risk for the Lannisters that
way, though quite an unpleasant surprise for their little friend.”

Ned felt his anger rise. “You knew of this plot, and yet you did nothing.”
“I command whisperers, not warriors.”
“You might have come to me earlier.”
“Oh, yes, I confess it. And you would have rushed straight to the king, yes? And when
Robert heard of his peril, what would he have done? I wonder.”
Ned considered that. “He would have damned them all, and fought anyway, to show he
did not fear them.”
Varys spread his hands. “I will make another confession, Lord Eddard. I was curious to
see what you would do. Why not come to me? you ask, and I must answer, Why, because
I did not trust you, my lord.”
“You did not trust me?” Ned was frankly astonished.
“The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people, Lord Eddard,” Varys said. “Those who are
loyal to the realm, and those who are loyal only to themselves. Until this morning, I
could not say which you might be . . . so I waited to see . . . and now I know, for a
certainty.” He smiled a plump tight little smile, and for a moment his private face and
public mask were one. “I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so much. Oh, yes
I do.”
“You are the one she ought to fear,” Ned said.
“No. I am what I am. The king makes use of me, but it shames him. A most puissant
warrior is our Robert, and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and spies and
eunuchs. If a day should come when Cersei whispers, ‘Kill that man,’ Ilyn Payne will
snick my head off in a twinkling, and who will mourn poor Varys then? North or south,
they sing no songs for spiders.” He reached out and touched Ned with a soft hand. “But
you, Lord Stark . . . I think . . . no, I know . . . he would not kill you, not even for his
queen, and there may lie our salvation.”
It was all too much. For a moment Eddard Stark wanted nothing so much as to return to
Winterfell, to the clean simplicity of the north, where the enemies were winter and the
wildlings beyond the Wall. “Surely Robert has other loyal friends,” he protested. “His
brothers, his—”
“—wife?” Varys finished, with a smile that cut. “His brothers hate the Lannisters, true
enough, but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing, are they?

Ser Barristan loves his honor, Grand Maester Pycelle loves his office, and Littlefinger
loves Littlefinger.”
“The Kingsguard—”
“A paper shield,” the eunuch said. “Try not to look so shocked, Lord Stark. Jaime
Lannister is himself a Sworn Brother of the White Swords, and we all know what his
oath is worth. The days when men like Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the
Dragonknight wore the white cloak are gone to dust and song. Of these seven, only Ser
Barristan Selmy is made of the true steel, and Selmy is old. Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are
the queen’s creatures to the bone, and I have deep suspicions of the others. No, my lord,
when the swords come out in earnest, you will be the only true friend Robert Baratheon
will have.”
“Robert must be told,” Ned said. “If what you say is true, if even a part of it is true, the
king must hear it for himself.”
“And what proof shall we lay before him? My words against theirs? My little birds
against the queen and the Kingslayer, against his brothers and his council, against the
Wardens of East and West, against all the might of Casterly Rock? Pray, send for Ser Ilyn
directly, it will save us all some time. I know where that road ends.”
“Yet if what you say is true, they will only bide their time and make another attempt.”
“Indeed they will,” said Varys, “and sooner rather than later, I do fear. You are making
them most anxious, Lord Eddard. But my little birds will be listening, and together we
may be able to forestall them, you and I.” He rose and pulled up his cowl so his face was
hidden once more. “Thank you for the wine. We will speak again. When you see me next
at council, be certain to treat me with your accustomed contempt. You should not find it
difficult.”
He was at the door when Ned called, “Varys.” The eunuch turned back. “How did Jon
Arryn die?”
“I wondered when you would get around to that.”
“Tell me.”
“The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, clear and sweet as water, and it
leaves no trace. I begged Lord Arryn to use a taster, in this very room I begged him, but
he would not hear of it. Only one who was less than a man would even think of such a
thing, he told me.”

Ned had to know the rest. “Who gave him the poison?”
“Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him, no doubt. Oh, but
which one? There were many such. Lord Arryn was a kindly, trusting man.” The eunuch
sighed. “There was one boy. All he was, he owed Jon Arryn, but when the widow fled to
the Eyrie with her household, he stayed in King’s Landing and prospered. It always
gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world.” The whip was in his voice again,
every word a stroke. “He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney, him in his bright
new armor, with those crescent moons on his cloak. A pity he died so untimely, before
you could talk to him . . . ”
Ned felt half-poisoned himself. “The squire,” he said. “Ser Hugh.” Wheels within wheels
within wheels. Ned’s head was pounding. “Why? Why now? Jon Arryn had been Hand
for fourteen years. What was he doing that they had to kill him?”
“Asking questions,” Varys said, slipping out the door.

TYRION
As he stood in the predawn chill watching Chiggen butcher his horse, Tyrion Lannister
chalked up one more debt owed the Starks. Steam rose from inside the carcass when the
squat sellsword opened the belly with his skinning knife. His hands moved deftly, with
never a wasted cut; the work had to be done quickly, before the stink of blood brought
shadowcats down from the heights.
“None of us will go hungry tonight,” Bronn said. He was near a shadow himself; bone
thin and bone hard, with black eyes and black hair and a stubble of beard.
“Some of us may,” Tyrion told him. “I am not fond of eating horse. Particularly my
horse.”
“Meat is meat,” Bronn said with a shrug. “The Dothraki like horse more than beef or
pork.”
“Do you take me for a Dothraki?” Tyrion asked sourly. The Dothraki ate horse, in truth;
they also left deformed children out for the feral dogs who ran behind their khalasars.
Dothraki customs had scant appeal for him.
Chiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held it up for inspection.
“Want a taste, dwarf?”
“My brother Jaime gave me that mare for my twenty-third name day,” Tyrion said in a
flat voice.
“Thank him for us, then. If you ever see him again.” Chiggen grinned, showing yellow
teeth, and swallowed the raw meat in two bites. “Tastes well bred.”
“Better if you fry it up with onions,” Bronn put in.
Wordlessly, Tyrion limped away. The cold had settled deep in his bones, and his legs
were so sore he could scarcely walk. Perhaps his dead mare was the lucky one. He had
hours more riding ahead of him, followed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short, cold
sleep on hard ground, and then another night of the same, and another, and another,
and the gods only knew how it would end. “Damn her,” he muttered as he struggled up

the road to rejoin his captors, remembering, “damn her and all the Starks.”
The memory was still bitter. One moment he’d been ordering supper, and an eye blink
later he was facing a room of armed men, with Jyck reaching for a sword and the fat
innkeep shrieking, “No swords, not here, please, m’lords.”
Tyrion wrenched down Jyck’s arm hurriedly, before he got them both hacked to pieces.
“Where are your courtesies, Jyck? Our good hostess said no swords. Do as she asks.” He
forced a smile that must have looked as queasy as it felt. “You’re making a sad mistake,
Lady Stark. I had no part in any attack on your son. On my honor—”
“Lannister honor,” was all she said. She held up her hands for all the room to see. “His
dagger left these scars. The blade he sent to open my son’s throat.”
Tyrion felt the anger all around him, thick and smoky, fed by the deep cuts in the Stark
woman’s hands. “Kill him,” hissed some drunken slattern from the back, and other
voices took up the call, faster than he would have believed. Strangers all, friendly enough
only a moment ago, and yet now they cried for his blood like hounds on a trail.
Tyrion spoke up loudly, trying to keep the quaver from his voice. “If Lady Stark believes
I have some crime to answer for, I will go with her and answer for it.”
It was the only possible course. Trying to cut their way out of this was a sure invitation to
an early grave. A good dozen swords had responded to the Stark woman’s plea for help:
the Harrenhal man, the three Brackens, a pair of unsavory sellswords who looked as
though they’d kill him as soon as spit, and some fool field hands who doubtless had no
idea what they were doing. Against that, what did Tyrion have? A dagger at his belt, and
two men. Jyck swung a fair enough sword, but Morrec scarcely counted; he was part
groom, part cook, part body servant, and no soldier. As for Yoren, whatever his feelings
might have been, the black brothers were sworn to take no part in the quarrels of the
realm. Yoren would do nothing.
And indeed, the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by Catelyn
Stark’s side said, “Take their weapons,” and the sellsword Bronn stepped forward to pull
the sword from Jyck’s fingers and relieve them all of their daggers. “Good,” the old man
said as the tension in the common room ebbed palpably, “excellent.” Tyrion recognized
the gruff voice; Winterfell’s master-at-arms, shorn of his whiskers.
Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep’s mouth as she begged of Catelyn Stark,
“Don’t kill him here!”
“Don’t kill him anywhere,” Tyrion urged.

“Take him somewheres else, no blood here, m’lady, I wants no high lordlin’s quarrels.”
“We are taking him back to Winterfell,” she said, and Tyrion thought, Well,
perhaps . . . By then he’d had a moment to glance over the room and get a better idea of
the situation. He was not altogether displeased by what he saw. Oh, the Stark woman
had been clever, no doubt of it. Force them to make a public affirmation of the oaths
sworn her father by the lords they served, and then call on them for succor, and her a
woman, yes, that was sweet. Yet her success was not as complete as she might have
liked. There were close to fifty in the common room by his rough count. Catelyn Stark’s
plea had roused a bare dozen; the others looked confused, or frightened, or sullen. Only
two of the Freys had stirred, Tyrion noted, and they’d sat back down quick enough when
their captain failed to move. He might have smiled if he’d dared.
“Winterfell it is, then,” he said instead. That was a long ride, as he could well attest,
having just ridden it the other way. So many things could happen along the way. “My
father will wonder what has become of me,” he added, catching the eye of the
swordsman who’d offered to yield up his room. “He’ll pay a handsome reward to any
man who brings him word of what happened here today.” Lord Tywin would do no such
thing, of course, but Tyrion would make up for it if he won free.
Ser Rodrik glanced at his lady, his look worried, as well it might be. “His men come with
him,” the old knight announced. “And we’ll thank the rest of you to stay quiet about
what you’ve seen here.”
It was all Tyrion could do not to laugh. Quiet? The old fool. Unless he took the whole
inn, the word would begin to spread the instant they were gone. The freerider with the
gold coin in his pocket would fly to Casterly Rock like an arrow. If not him, then
someone else. Yoren would carry the story south. That fool singer might make a lay of it.
The Freys would report back to their lord, and the gods only knew what he might do.
Lord Walder Frey might be sworn to Riverrun, but he was a cautious man who had lived
a long time by making certain he was always on the winning side. At the very least he
would send his birds winging south to King’s Landing, and he might well dare more than
that.
Catelyn Stark wasted no time. “We must ride at once. We’ll want fresh mounts, and
provisions for the road. You men, know that you have the eternal gratitude of House
Stark. If any of you choose to help us guard our captives and get them safe to Winterfell,
I promise you shall be well rewarded.” That was all it took; the fools came rushing
forward. Tyrion studied their faces; they would indeed be well rewarded, he vowed to
himself, but perhaps not quite as they imagined.

Yet even as they were bundling him outside, saddling the horses in the rain, and tying
his hands with a length of coarse rope, Tyrion Lannister was not truly afraid. They would
never get him to Winterfell, he would have given odds on that. Riders would be after
them within the day, birds would take wing, and surely one of the river lords would want
to curry favor with his father enough to take a hand. Tyrion was congratulating himself
on his subtlety when someone pulled a hood down over his eyes and lifted him up onto a
saddle.
They set out through the rain at a hard gallop, and before long Tyrion’s thighs were
cramped and aching and his butt throbbed with pain. Even when they were safely away
from the inn, and Catelyn Stark slowed them to a trot, it was a miserable pounding
journey over rough ground, made worse by his blindness. Every twist and turn put him
in danger of falling off his horse. The hood muffled sound, so he could not make out
what was being said around him, and the rain soaked through the cloth and made it
cling to his face, until even breathing was a struggle. The rope chafed his wrists raw and
seemed to grow tighter as the night wore on. I was about to settle down to a warm fire
and a roast fowl, and that wretched singer had to open his mouth, he thought
mournfully. The wretched singer had come along with them. “There is a great song to be
made from this, and I’m the one to make it,” he told Catelyn Stark when he announced
his intention of riding with them to see how the “splendid adventure” turned out. Tyrion
wondered whether the boy would think the adventure quite so splendid once the
Lannister riders caught up with them.
The rain had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth over his
eyes when Catelyn Stark gave the command to dismount. Rough hands pulled him down
from his horse, untied his wrists, and yanked the hood off his head. When he saw the
narrow stony road, the foothills rising high and wild all around them, and the jagged
snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon, all the hope went out of him in a rush. “This is
the high road,” he gasped, looking at Lady Stark with accusation. “The eastern road. You
said we were riding for Winterfell!”
Catelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles. “Often and loudly,” she agreed.
“No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us. I wish them good
speed.”
Even now, long days later, the memory filled him with a bitter rage. All his life Tyrion
had prided himself on his cunning, the only gift the gods had seen fit to give him, and yet
this seven-times-damned she-wolf Catelyn Stark had outwitted him at every turn. The
knowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his abduction.
They stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses, and then they were off
again. This time Tyrion was spared the hood. After the second night they no longer

bound his hands, and once they had gained the heights they scarcely bothered to guard
him at all. It seemed they did not fear his escape. And why should they? Up here the land
was harsh and wild, and the high road little more than a stony track. If he did run, how
far could he hope to go, alone and without provisions? The shadowcats would make a
morsel of him, and the clans that dwelt in the mountain fastnesses were brigands and
murderers who bowed to no law but the sword.
Yet still the Stark woman drove them forward relentlessly. He knew where they were
bound. He had known it since the moment they pulled off his hood. These mountains
were the domain of House Arryn, and the late Hand’s widow was a Tully, Catelyn Stark’s
sister . . . and no friend to the Lannisters. Tyrion had known the Lady Lysa slightly
during her years at King’s Landing, and did not look forward to renewing the
acquaintance.
His captors were clustered around a stream a short ways down the high road. The horses
had drunk their fill of the icy cold water, and were grazing on clumps of brown grass that
grew from clefts in the rock. Jyck and Morrec huddled close, sullen and miserable.
Mohor stood over them, leaning on his spear and wearing a rounded iron cap that made
him look as if he had a bowl on his head. Nearby, Marillion the singer sat oiling his
woodharp, complaining of what the damp was doing to his strings.
“We must have some rest, my lady,” the hedge knight Ser Willis Wode was saying to
Catelyn Stark as Tyrion approached. He was Lady Whent’s man, stiff-necked and stolid,
and the first to rise to aid Catelyn Stark back at the inn.
“Ser Willis speaks truly, my lady,” Ser Rodrik said. “This is the third horse we have lost
—”
“We will lose more than horses if we’re overtaken by the Lannisters,” she reminded
them. Her face was windburnt and gaunt, but it had lost none of its determination.
“Small chance of that here,” Tyrion put in.
“The lady did not ask your views, dwarf,” snapped Kurleket, a great fat oaf with shortcropped hair and a pig’s face. He was one of the Brackens, a man-at-arms in the service
of Lord Jonos. Tyrion had made a special effort to learn all their names, so he might
thank them later for their tender treatment of him. A Lannister always paid his debts.
Kurleket would learn that someday, as would his friends Lharys and Mohor, and the
good Ser Willis, and the sellswords Bronn and Chiggen. He planned an especially sharp
lesson for Marillion, him of the woodharp and the sweet tenor voice, who was struggling
so manfully to rhyme imp with gimp and limp so he could make a song of this outrage.

“Let him speak,” Lady Stark commanded.
Tyrion Lannister seated himself on a rock. “By now our pursuit is likely racing across the
Neck, chasing your lie up the kingsroad . . . assuming there is a pursuit, which is by no
means certain. Oh, no doubt the word has reached my father . . . but my father does not
love me overmuch, and I am not at all sure that he will bother to bestir himself.” It was
only half a lie; Lord Tywin Lannister cared not a fig for his deformed son, but he
tolerated no slights on the honor of his House. “This is a cruel land, Lady Stark. You’ll
find no succor until you reach the Vale, and each mount you lose burdens the others all
the more. Worse, you risk losing me. I am small, and not strong, and if I die, then what’s
the point?” That was no lie at all; Tyrion did not know how much longer he could endure
this pace.
“It might be said that your death is the point, Lannister,” Catelyn Stark replied.
“I think not,” Tyrion said. “If you wanted me dead, you had only to say the word, and one
of these staunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red smile.” He looked at
Kurleket, but the man was too dim to taste the mockery.
“The Starks do not murder men in their beds.”
“Nor do I,” he said. “I tell you again, I had no part in the attempt to kill your son.”
“The assassin was armed with your dagger.”
Tyrion felt the heat rise in him. “It was not my dagger,” he insisted. “How many times
must I swear to that? Lady Stark, whatever you may believe of me, I am not a stupid
man. Only a fool would arm a common footpad with his own blade.”
Just for a moment, he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes, but what she said
was, “Why would Petyr lie to me?”
“Why does a bear shit in the woods?” he demanded. “Because it is his nature. Lying
comes as easily as breathing to a man like Littlefinger. You ought to know that, you of all
people.”
She took a step toward him, her face tight. “And what does that mean, Lannister?”
Tyrion cocked his head. “Why, every man at court has heard him tell how he took your
maidenhead, my lady.”
“That is a lie!” Catelyn Stark said.

“Oh, wicked little imp,” Marillion said, shocked.
Kurleket drew his dirk, a vicious piece of black iron. “At your word, m’lady, I’ll toss his
lying tongue at your feet.” His pig eyes were wet with excitement at the prospect.
Catelyn Stark stared at Tyrion with a coldness on her face such as he had never seen.
“Petyr Baelish loved me once. He was only a boy. His passion was a tragedy for all of us,
but it was real, and pure, and nothing to be made mock of. He wanted my hand. That is
the truth of the matter. You are truly an evil man, Lannister.”
“And you are truly a fool, Lady Stark. Littlefinger has never loved anyone but
Littlefinger, and I promise you that it is not your hand that he boasts of, it’s those ripe
breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and the heat between your legs.”
Kurleket grabbed a handful of hair and yanked his head back in a hard jerk, baring his
throat. Tyrion felt the cold kiss of steel beneath his chin. “Shall I bleed him, my lady?”
“Kill me and the truth dies with me,” Tyrion gasped.
“Let him talk,” Catelyn Stark commanded.
Kurleket let go of Tyrion’s hair, reluctantly.
Tyrion took a deep breath. “How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of his?
Answer me that.”
“You won it from him in a wager, during the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day.”
“When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers, that was his story, no?”
“It was,” she admitted. A line creased her brow.
“Riders!”
The shriek came from the wind-carved ridge above them. Ser Rodrik had sent Lharys
scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took their rest.
For a long second, no one moved. Catelyn Stark was the first to react. “Ser Rodrik, Ser
Willis, to horse,” she shouted. “Get the other mounts behind us. Mohor, guard the
prisoners—”

“Arm us!” Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm. “You will need every
sword.”
She knew he was right, Tyrion could see it. The mountain clans cared nothing for the
enmities of the great houses; they would slaughter Stark and Lannister with equal
fervor, as they slaughtered each other. They might spare Catelyn herself; she was still
young enough to bear sons. Still, she hesitated.
“I hear them!” Ser Rodrik called out. Tyrion turned his head to listen, and there it was:
hoofbeats, a dozen horses or more, coming nearer. Suddenly everyone was moving,
reaching for weapons, running to their mounts.
Pebbles rained down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge.
He landed breathless in front of Catelyn Stark, an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts
of rust-colored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap. “Twenty men, maybe
twenty-five,” he said, breathless. “Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers, by my guess. They
must have eyes out, m’lady . . . hidden watchers . . . they know we’re here.”
Ser Rodrik Cassel was already ahorse, a longsword in hand. Mohor crouched behind a
boulder, both hands on his iron-tipped spear, a dagger between his teeth. “You, singer,”
Ser Willis Wode called out. “Help me with this breastplate.” Marillion sat frozen,
clutching his woodharp, his face as pale as milk, but Tyrion’s man Morrec bounded
quickly to his feet and moved to help the knight with his armor.
Tyrion kept his grip on Catelyn Stark. “You have no choice,” he told her. “Three of us,
and a fourth man wasted guarding us . . . four men can be the difference between life and
death up here.”
“Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done.”
“My word?” The hoofbeats were louder now. Tyrion grinned crookedly. “Oh, that you
have, my lady . . . on my honor as a Lannister.”
For a moment he thought she would spit at him, but instead she snapped, “Arm them,”
and as quick as that she was pulling away. Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck his sword and
scabbard, and wheeled to meet the foe. Morrec helped himself to a bow and quiver, and
went to one knee beside the road. He was a better archer than swordsman. And Bronn
rode up to offer Tyrion a double-bladed axe.
“I have never fought with an axe.” The weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar in his hands.
It had a short haft, a heavy head, a nasty spike on top.

“Pretend you’re splitting logs,” Bronn said, drawing his longsword from the scabbard
across his back. He spat, and trotted off to form up beside Chiggen and Ser Rodrik. Ser
Willis mounted up to join them, fumbling with his helmet, a metal pot with a thin slit for
his eyes and a long black silk plume.
“Logs don’t bleed,” Tyrion said to no one in particular. He felt naked without armor. He
looked around for a rock and ran over to where Marillion was hiding. “Move over.”
“Go away!” the boy screamed back at him. “I’m a singer, I want no part of this fight!”
“What, lost your taste for adventure?” Tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid over, and
not a moment too soon. A heartbeat later, the riders were on them.
There were no heralds, no banners, no horns nor drums, only the twang of bowstrings as
Morrec and Lharys let fly, and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn,
lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor, faces hidden behind barred
halfhelms. In gloved hands were clutched all manner of weapons: longswords and lances
and sharpened scythes, spiked clubs and daggers and heavy iron mauls. At their head
rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak, armed with a two-handed greatsword.
Ser Rodrik shouted “Winterfell!” and rode to meet him, with Bronn and Chiggen beside
him, screaming some wordless battle cry. Ser Willis Wode followed, swinging a spiked
morningstar around his head. “Harrenhal! Harrenhal!” he sang. Tyrion felt a sudden
urge to leap up, brandish his axe, and boom out, “Casterly Rock!” but the insanity passed
quickly and he crouched down lower.
He heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal. Chiggen’s
sword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider, and Bronn plunged through the
clansmen like a whirlwind, cutting down foes right and left. Ser Rodrik hammered at the
big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses dancing round each other as they traded
blow for blow. Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray. Tyrion saw
an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak. When he opened
his mouth to scream, only blood came out. By the time he fell, Ser Rodrik was fighting
someone else.
Suddenly Marillion shrieked, covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over
their rock. Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the rider turned to come back at them, hefting
a spiked maul. Tyrion swung his axe with both hands. The blade caught the charging
horse in the throat with a meaty thunk, angling upward, and Tyrion almost lost his grip
as the animal screamed and collapsed. He managed to wrench the axe free and lurch
clumsily out of the way. Marillion was less fortunate. Horse and rider crashed to the
ground in a tangle on top of the singer. Tyrion danced back in while the brigand’s leg

was still pinned beneath his fallen mount, and buried the axe in the man’s neck, just
above the shoulder blades.
As he struggled to yank the blade loose, he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies.
“Someone help me,” the singer gasped. “Gods have mercy, I’m bleeding.”
“I believe that’s horse blood,” Tyrion said. The singer’s hand came crawling out from
beneath the dead animal, scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs. Tyrion put his
heel on the grasping fingers and felt a satisfying crunch. “Close your eyes and pretend
you’re dead,” he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away.
After that, things ran together. The dawn was full of shouts and screams and heavy with
the scent of blood, and the world had turned to chaos. Arrows hissed past his ear and
clattered off the rocks. He saw Bronn unhorsed, fighting with a sword in each hand.
Tyrion kept on the fringes of the fight, sliding from rock to rock and darting out of the
shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses. He found a wounded clansman and left
him dead, helping himself to the man’s halfhelm. It fit too snugly, but Tyrion was glad of
any protection at all. Jyck was cut down from behind while he sliced at a man in front of
him, and later Tyrion stumbled over Kurleket’s body. The pig face had been smashed in
with a mace, but Tyrion recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the man’s dead
fingers. He was sliding it through his belt when he heard a woman’s scream.
Catelyn Stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three men around
her, one still mounted and the other two on foot. She had a dagger clutched awkwardly
in her maimed hands, but her back was to the rock now and they had penned her on
three sides. Let them have the bitch, Tyrion thought, and welcome to her, yet somehow
he was moving. He caught the first man in the back of the knee before they even knew he
was there, and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood. Logs that bleed,
Tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for him. Tyrion ducked under his sword,
lashed out with the axe, the man reeled backward . . . and Catelyn Stark stepped up
behind him and opened his throat. The horseman remembered an urgent engagement
elsewhere and galloped off suddenly.
Tyrion looked around. The enemy were all vanquished or vanished. Somehow the
fighting had ended when he wasn’t looking. Dying horses and wounded men lay all
around, screaming or moaning. To his vast astonishment, he was not one of them. He
opened his fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground. His hands were sticky with
blood. He could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day, but the sun seemed
scarcely to have moved at all.
“Your first battle?” Bronn asked later as he bent over Jyck’s body, pulling off his boots.
They were good boots, as befit one of Lord Tywin’s men; heavy leather, oiled and supple,

much finer than what Bronn was wearing.
Tyrion nodded. “My father will be so proud,” he said. His legs were cramping so badly he
could scarcely stand. Odd, he had never once noticed the pain during the battle.
“You need a woman now,” Bronn said with a glint in his black eyes. He shoved the boots
into his saddlebag. “Nothing like a woman after a man’s been blooded, take my word.”
Chiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and lick his
lips.
Tyrion glanced over to where Lady Stark was dressing Ser Rodrik’s wounds. “I’m willing
if she is,” he said. The freeriders broke into laughter, and Tyrion grinned and thought,
There’s a start.
Afterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off his face in water cold as ice.
As he limped back to the others, he glanced again at the slain. The dead clansmen were
thin, ragged men, their horses scrawny and undersized, with every rib showing. What
weapons Bronn and Chiggen had left them were none too impressive. Mauls, clubs, a
scythe . . . He remembered the big man in the shadowskin cloak who had dueled Ser
Rodrik with a two-handed greatsword, but when he found his corpse sprawled on the
stony ground, the man was not so big after all, the cloak was gone, and Tyrion saw that
the blade was badly notched, its cheap steel spotted with rust. Small wonder the
clansmen had left nine bodies on the ground.
They had only three dead; two of Lord Bracken’s men-at-arms, Kurleket and Mohor, and
his own man Jyck, who had made such a bold show with his bareback charge. A fool to
the end, Tyrion thought.
“Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste,” Ser Willis Wode said, his eyes
scanning the ridgetops warily through the slit in his helm. “We drove them off for the
moment, but they will not have gone far.”
“We must bury our dead, Ser Willis,” she said. “These were brave men. I will not leave
them to the crows and shadowcats.”
“This soil is too stony for digging,” Ser Willis said.
“Then we shall gather stones for cairns.”
“Gather all the stones you want,” Bronn told her, “but do it without me or Chiggen. I’ve
better things to do than pile rocks on dead men . . . breathing, for one.” He looked over

the rest of the survivors. “Any of you who hope to be alive come nightfall, ride with us.”
“My lady, I fear he speaks the truth,” Ser Rodrik said wearily. The old knight had been
wounded in the fight, a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that grazed his neck,
and he sounded his age. “If we linger here, they will be on us again for a certainty, and
we may not live through a second attack.”
Tyrion could see the anger in Catelyn’s face, but she had no choice. “May the gods
forgive us, then. We will ride at once.”
There was no shortage of horses now. Tyrion moved his saddle to Jyck’s spotted gelding,
who looked strong enough to last another three or four days at least. He was about to
mount when Lharys stepped up and said, “I’ll take that dirk now, dwarf.”
“Let him keep it.” Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse. “And see that he has his
axe back as well. We may have need of it if we are attacked again.”
“You have my thanks, lady,” Tyrion said, mounting up.
“Save them,” she said curtly. “I trust you no more than I did before.” She was gone
before he could frame a reply.
Tyrion adjusted his stolen helm and took the axe from Bronn. He remembered how he
had begun the journey, with his wrists bound and a hood pulled down over his head, and
decided that this was a definite improvement. Lady Stark could keep her trust; so long as
he could keep the axe, he would count himself ahead in the game.
Ser Willis Wode led them out. Bronn took the rear, with Lady Stark safely in the middle,
Ser Rodrik a shadow beside her. Marillion kept throwing sullen looks back at Tyrion as
they rode. The singer had broken several ribs, his woodharp, and all four fingers on his
playing hand, yet the day had not been an utter loss to him; somewhere he had acquired
a magnificent shadowskin cloak, thick black fur slashed by stripes of white. He huddled
beneath its folds silently, and for once had nothing to say.
They heard the deep growls of shadowcats behind them before they had gone half a mile,
and later the wild snarling of the beasts fighting over the corpses they had left behind.
Marillion grew visibly pale. Tyrion trotted up beside him. “Craven,” he said, “rhymes
nicely with raven.” He kicked his horse and moved past the singer, up to Ser Rodrik and
Catelyn Stark.
She looked at him, lips pressed tightly together.

“As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted,” Tyrion began, “there is a serious
flaw in Littlefinger’s fable. Whatever you may believe of me, Lady Stark, I promise you
this—I never bet against my family.”

ARYA
The one-eared black tom arched his back and hissed at her.
Arya padded down the alley, balanced lightly on the balls of her bare feet, listening to the
flutter of her heart, breathing slow deep breaths. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself,
light as a feather. The tomcat watched her come, his eyes wary.
Catching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both
knees were scabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the
cook’s huge fat kitchen cat had been able to elude her, but Syrio had kept her at it day
and night. When she’d run to him with her hands bleeding, he had said, “So slow? Be
quicker, girl. Your enemies will give you more than scratches.” He had dabbed her
wounds with Myrish fire, which burned so bad she had had to bite her lip to keep from
screaming. Then he sent her out after more cats.
The Red Keep was full of cats: lazy old cats dozing in the sun, cold-eyed mousers
twitching their tails, quick little kittens with claws like needles, ladies’ cats all combed
and trusting, ragged shadows prowling the midden heaps. One by one Arya had chased
them down and snatched them up and brought them proudly to Syrio Forel . . . all but
this one, this one-eared black devil of a tomcat. “That’s the real king of this castle right
there,” one of the gold cloaks had told her. “Older than sin and twice as mean. One time,
the king was feasting the queen’s father, and that black bastard hopped up on the table
and snatched a roast quail right out of Lord Tywin’s fingers. Robert laughed so hard he
like to burst. You stay away from that one, child.”
He had run her halfway across the castle; twice around the Tower of the Hand, across
the inner bailey, through the stables, down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen
and the pig yard and the barracks of the gold cloaks, along the base of the river wall and
up more steps and back and forth over Traitor’s Walk, and then down again and through
a gate and around a well and in and out of strange buildings until Arya didn’t know
where she was.
Now at last she had him. High walls pressed close on either side, and ahead was a blank
windowless mass of stone. Quiet as a shadow, she repeated, sliding forward, light as a
feather.

When she was three steps away from him, the tomcat bolted. Left, then right, he went;
and right, then left, went Arya, cutting off his escape. He hissed again and tried to dart
between her legs. Quick as a snake, she thought. Her hands closed around him. She
hugged him to her chest, whirling and laughing aloud as his claws raked at the front of
her leather jerkin. Ever so fast, she kissed him right between the eyes, and jerked her
head back an instant before his claws would have found her face. The tomcat yowled and
spit.
“What’s he doing to that cat?”
Startled, Arya dropped the cat and whirled toward the voice. The tom bounded off in the
blink of an eye. At the end of the alley stood a girl with a mass of golden curls, dressed as
pretty as a doll in blue satin. Beside her was a plump little blond boy with a prancing
stag sewn in pearls across the front of his doublet and a miniature sword at his belt.
Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen, Arya thought. A septa as large as a draft horse
hovered over them, and behind her two big men in crimson cloaks, Lannister house
guards.
“What were you doing to that cat, boy?” Myrcella asked again, sternly. To her brother
she said, “He’s a ragged boy, isn’t he? Look at him.” She giggled.
“A ragged dirty smelly boy,” Tommen agreed.
They don’t know me, Arya realized. They don’t even know I’m a girl. Small wonder; she
was barefoot and dirty, her hair tangled from the long run through the castle, clad in a
jerkin ripped by cat claws and brown roughspun pants hacked off above her scabby
knees. You don’t wear skirts and silks when you’re catching cats. Quickly she lowered
her head and dropped to one knee. Maybe they wouldn’t recognize her. If they did, she
would never hear the end of it. Septa Mordane would be mortified, and Sansa would
never speak to her again from the shame.
The old fat septa moved forward. “Boy, how did you come here? You have no business in
this part of the castle.”
“You can’t keep this sort out,” one of the red cloaks said. “Like trying to keep out rats.”
“Who do you belong to, boy?” the septa demanded. “Answer me. What’s wrong with you,
are you mute?”
Arya’s voice caught in her throat. If she answered, Tommen and Myrcella would know
her for certain.

“Godwyn, bring him here,” the septa said. The taller of the guardsmen started down the
alley.
Panic gripped her throat like a giant’s hand. Arya could not have spoken if her life had
hung on it. Calm as still water, she mouthed silently.
As Godwyn reached for her, Arya moved. Quick as a snake. She leaned to her left, letting
his fingers brush her arm, spinning around him. Smooth as summer silk. By the time he
got himself turned, she was sprinting down the alley. Swift as a deer. The septa was
screeching at her. Arya slid between legs as thick and white as marble columns, bounded
to her feet, bowled into Prince Tommen and hopped over him when he sat down hard
and said “Oof,” spun away from the second guard, and then she was past them all,
running full out.
She heard shouts, then pounding footsteps, closing behind her. She dropped and rolled.
The red cloak went careening past her, stumbling. Arya sprang back to her feet. She saw
a window above her, high and narrow, scarcely more than an arrow slit. Arya leapt,
caught the sill, pulled herself up. She held her breath as she wriggled through. Slippery
as an eel. Dropping to the floor in front of a startled scrubwoman, she hopped up,
brushed the rushes off her clothes, and was off again, out the door and along a long hall,
down a stair, across a hidden courtyard, around a corner and over a wall and through a
low narrow window into a pitch-dark cellar. The sounds grew more and more distant
behind her.
Arya was out of breath and quite thoroughly lost. She was in for it now if they had
recognized her, but she didn’t think they had. She’d moved too fast. Swift as a deer.
She hunkered down in the dark against a damp stone wall and listened for the pursuit,
but the only sound was the beating of her own heart and a distant drip of water. Quiet as
a shadow, she told herself. She wondered where she was. When they had first come to
King’s Landing, she used to have bad dreams about getting lost in the castle. Father said
the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in her dreams it had been immense, an
endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her. She would
find herself wandering down gloomy halls past faded tapestries, descending endless
circular stairs, darting through courtyards or over bridges, her shouts echoing
unanswered. In some of the rooms the red stone walls would seem to drip blood, and
nowhere could she find a window. Sometimes she would hear her father’s voice, but
always from a long way off, and no matter how hard she ran after it, it would grow
fainter and fainter, until it faded to nothing and Arya was alone in the dark.
It was very dark right now, she realized. She hugged her bare knees tight against her
chest and shivered. She would wait quietly and count to ten thousand. By then it would

be safe for her to come creeping back out and find her way home.
By the time she had reached eighty-seven, the room had begun to lighten as her eyes
adjusted to the blackness. Slowly the shapes around her took on form. Huge empty eyes
stared at her hungrily through the gloom, and dimly she saw the jagged shadows of long
teeth. She had lost the count. She closed her eyes and bit her lip and sent the fear away.
When she looked again, the monsters would be gone. Would never have been. She
pretended that Syrio was beside her in the dark, whispering in her ear. Calm as still
water, she told herself. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. She opened her eyes
again.
The monsters were still there, but the fear was gone.
Arya got to her feet, moving warily. The heads were all around her. She touched one,
curious, wondering if it was real. Her fingertips brushed a massive jaw. It felt real
enough. The bone was smooth beneath her hand, cold and hard to the touch. She ran her
fingers down a tooth, black and sharp, a dagger made of darkness. It made her shiver.
“It’s dead,” she said aloud. “It’s just a skull, it can’t hurt me.” Yet somehow the monster
seemed to know she was there. She could feel its empty eyes watching her through the
gloom, and there was something in that dim, cavernous room that did not love her. She
edged away from the skull and backed into a second, larger than the first. For an instant
she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder, as if it wanted a bite of her flesh. Arya
whirled, felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang nipped at her jerkin, and then she was
running. Another skull loomed ahead, the biggest monster of all, but Arya did not even
slow. She leapt over a ridge of black teeth as tall as swords, dashed through hungry jaws,
and threw herself against the door.
Her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood, and she yanked at it. The door
resisted a moment, before it slowly began to swing inward, with a creak so loud Arya
was certain it could be heard all through the city. She opened the door just far enough to
slip through, into the hallway beyond.
If the room with the monsters had been dark, the hall was the blackest pit in the seven
hells. Calm as still water, Arya told herself, but even when she gave her eyes a moment
to adjust, there was nothing to see but the vague grey outline of the door she had come
through. She wiggled her fingers in front of her face, felt the air move, saw nothing. She
was blind. A water dancer sees with all her senses, she reminded herself. She closed her
eyes and steadied her breathing one two three, drank in the quiet, reached out with her
hands.
Her fingers brushed against rough unfinished stone to her left. She followed the wall, her

hand skimming along the surface, taking small gliding steps through the darkness. All
halls lead somewhere. Where there is a way in, there is a way out. Fear cuts deeper
than swords. Arya would not be afraid. It seemed as if she had been walking a long ways
when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew past her cheek. Loose hairs
stirred faintly against her skin.
From somewhere far below her, she heard noises. The scrape of boots, the distant sound
of voices. A flickering light brushed the wall ever so faintly, and she saw that she stood at
the top of a great black well, a shaft twenty feet across plunging deep into the earth.
Huge stones had been set into the curving walls as steps, circling down and down, dark
as the steps to hell that Old Nan used to tell them of. And something was coming up out
of the darkness, out of the bowels of the earth . . .
Arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face. Far below, she saw
the light of a single torch, small as the flame of a candle. Two men, she made out. Their
shadows writhed against the sides of the well, tall as giants. She could hear their voices,
echoing up the shaft.
“ . . . found one bastard,” one said. “The rest will come soon. A day, two days, a
fortnight . . . ”
“And when he learns the truth, what will he do?” a second voice asked in the liquid
accents of the Free Cities.
“The gods alone know,” the first voice said. Arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting
up off the torch, writhing like a snake as it rose. “The fools tried to kill his son, and
what’s worse, they made a mummer’s farce of it. He’s not a man to put that aside. I warn
you, the wolf and lion will soon be at each other’s throats, whether we will it or no.”
“Too soon, too soon,” the voice with the accent complained. “What good is war now? We
are not ready. Delay.”
“As well bid me stop time. Do you take me for a wizard?”
The other chuckled. “No less.” Flames licked at the cold air. The tall shadows were
almost on top of her. An instant later the man holding the torch climbed into her sight,
his companion beside him. Arya crept back away from the well, dropped to her stomach,
and flattened herself against the wall. She held her breath as the men reached the top of
the steps.
“What would you have me do?” asked the torchbearer, a stout man in a leather half cape.
Even in heavy boots, his feet seemed to glide soundlessly over the ground. A round

scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his steel cap, and he wore mail
over boiled leather, and a dirk and shortsword at his belt. It seemed to Arya there was
something oddly familiar about him.
“If one Hand can die, why not a second?” replied the man with the accent and the forked
yellow beard. “You have danced the dance before, my friend.” He was no one Arya had
ever seen before, she was certain of it. Grossly fat, yet he seemed to walk lightly, carrying
his weight on the balls of his feet as a water dancer might. His rings glimmered in the
torchlight, red-gold and pale silver, crusted with rubies, sapphires, slitted yellow tiger
eyes. Every finger wore a ring; some had two.
“Before is not now, and this Hand is not the other,” the scarred man said as they stepped
out into the hall. Still as stone, Arya told herself, quiet as a shadow. Blinded by the blaze
of their own torch, they did not see her pressed flat against the stone, only a few feet
away.
“Perhaps so,” the forked beard replied, pausing to catch his breath after the long climb.
“Nonetheless, we must have time. The princess is with child. The khal will not bestir
himself until his son is born. You know how they are, these savages.”
The man with the torch pushed at something. Arya heard a deep rumbling. A huge slab
of rock, red in the torchlight, slid down out of the ceiling with a resounding crash that
almost made her cry out. Where the entry to the well had been was nothing but stone,
solid and unbroken.
“If he does not bestir himself soon, it may be too late,” the stout man in the steel cap
said. “This is no longer a game for two players, if ever it was. Stannis Baratheon and
Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my reach, and the whispers say they are gathering swords
around them. The Knight of Flowers writes Highgarden, urging his lord father to send
his sister to court. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and beautiful and tractable, and
Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed her, wed her, and make a new
queen. Littlefinger . . . the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing. Yet Lord
Stark’s the one who troubles my sleep. He has the bastard, he has the book, and soon
enough he’ll have the truth. And now his wife has abducted Tyrion Lannister, thanks to
Littlefinger’s meddling. Lord Tywin will take that for an outrage, and Jaime has a queer
affection for the Imp. If the Lannisters move north, that will bring the Tullys in as well.
Delay, you say. Make haste, I reply. Even the finest of jugglers cannot keep a hundred
balls in the air forever.”
“You are more than a juggler, old friend. You are a true sorcerer. All I ask is that you
work your magic awhile longer.” They started down the hall in the direction Arya had
come, past the room with the monsters.

“What I can do, I will,” the one with the torch said softly. “I must have gold, and another
fifty birds.”
She let them get a long way ahead, then went creeping after them. Quiet as a shadow.
“So many?” The voices were fainter as the light dwindled ahead of her. “The ones you
need are hard to find . . . so young, to know their letters . . . perhaps older . . . not die so
easy . . . ”
“No. The younger are safer . . . treat them gently . . . ”
“ . . . .if they kept their tongues . . . ”
“ . . . the risk . . . ”
Long after their voices had faded away, Arya could still see the light of the torch, a
smoking star that bid her follow. Twice it seemed to disappear, but she kept on straight,
and both times she found herself at the top of steep, narrow stairs, the torch glimmering
far below her. She hurried after it, down and down. Once she stumbled over a rock and
fell against the wall, and her hand found raw earth supported by timbers, whereas before
the tunnel had been dressed stone.
She must have crept after them for miles. Finally they were gone, but there was no place
to go but forward. She found the wall again and followed, blind and lost, pretending that
Nymeria was padding along beside her in the darkness. At the end she was knee-deep in
foul-smelling water, wishing she could dance upon it as Syrio might have, and
wondering if she’d ever see light again. It was full dark when finally Arya emerged into
the night air.
She found herself standing at the mouth of a sewer where it emptied into the river. She
stank so badly that she stripped right there, dropping her soiled clothing on the
riverbank as she dove into the deep black waters. She swam until she felt clean, and
crawled out shivering. Some riders went past along the river road as Arya was washing
her clothes, but if they saw the scrawny naked girl scrubbing her rags in the moonlight,
they took no notice.
She was miles from the castle, but from anywhere in King’s Landing you needed only to
look up to see the Red Keep high on Aegon’s Hill, so there was no danger of losing her
way. Her clothes were almost dry by the time she reached the gatehouse. The portcullis
was down and the gates barred, so she turned aside to a postern door. The gold cloaks
who had the watch sneered when she told them to let her in. “Off with you,” one said.

“The kitchen scraps are gone, and we’ll have no begging after dark.”
“I’m not a beggar,” she said. “I live here.”
“I said, off with you. Do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?”
“I want to see my father.”
The guards exchanged a glance. “I want to fuck the queen myself, for all the good it does
me,” the younger one said.
The older scowled. “Who’s this father of yours, boy, the city ratcatcher?”
“The Hand of the King,” Arya told him.
Both men laughed, but then the older one swung his fist at her, casually, as a man would
swat a dog. Arya saw the blow coming even before it began. She danced back out of the
way, untouched. “I’m not a boy,” she spat at them. “I’m Arya Stark of Winterfell, and if
you lay a hand on me my lord father will have both your heads on spikes. If you don’t
believe me, fetch Jory Cassel or Vayon Poole from the Tower of the Hand.” She put her
hands on her hips. “Now are you going to open the gate, or do you need a clout on the
ear to help your hearing?”
Her father was alone in the solar when Harwin and Fat Tom marched her in, an oil lamp
glowing softly at his elbow. He was bent over the biggest book Arya had ever seen, a
great thick tome with cracked yellow pages of crabbed script, bound between faded
leather covers, but he closed it to listen to Harwin’s report. His face was stern as he sent
the men away with thanks.
“You realize I had half my guard out searching for you?” Eddard Stark said when they
were alone. “Septa Mordane is beside herself with fear. She’s in the sept praying for your
safe return. Arya, you know you are never to go beyond the castle gates without my
leave.”
“I didn’t go out the gates,” she blurted. “Well, I didn’t mean to. I was down in the
dungeons, only they turned into this tunnel. It was all dark, and I didn’t have a torch or a
candle to see by, so I had to follow. I couldn’t go back the way I came on account of the
monsters. Father, they were talking about killing you! Not the monsters, the two men.
They didn’t see me, I was being still as stone and quiet as a shadow, but I heard them.
They said you had a book and a bastard and if one Hand could die, why not a second? Is
that the book? Jon’s the bastard, I bet.”

“Jon? Arya, what are you talking about? Who said this?”
“They did,” she told him. “There was a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard, and
another in mail and a steel cap, and the fat one said they had to delay but the other one
told him he couldn’t keep juggling and the wolf and the lion were going to eat each other
and it was a mummer’s farce.” She tried to remember the rest. She hadn’t quite
understood everything she’d heard, and now it was all mixed up in her head. “The fat
one said the princess was with child. The one in the steel cap, he had the torch, he said
that they had to hurry. I think he was a wizard.”
“A wizard,” said Ned, unsmiling. “Did he have a long white beard and tall pointed hat
speckled with stars?”
“No! It wasn’t like Old Nan’s stories. He didn’t look like a wizard, but the fat one said he
was.”
“I warn you, Arya, if you’re spinning this thread of air—”
“No, I told you, it was in the dungeons, by the place with the secret wall. I was chasing
cats, and well . . . ” She screwed up her face. If she admitted knocking over Prince
Tommen, he would be really angry with her. “ . . . well, I went in this window. That’s
where I found the monsters.”
“Monsters and wizards,” her father said. “It would seem you’ve had quite an adventure.
These men you heard, you say they spoke of juggling and mummery?”
“Yes,” Arya admitted, “only—”
“Arya, they were mummers,” her father told her. “There must be a dozen troupes in
King’s Landing right now, come to make some coin off the tourney crowds. I’m not
certain what these two were doing in the castle, but perhaps the king has asked for a
show.”
“No.” She shook her head stubbornly. “They weren’t—”
“You shouldn’t be following people about and spying on them in any case. Nor do I
cherish the notion of my daughter climbing in strange windows after stray cats. Look at
you, sweetling. Your arms are covered with scratches. This has gone on long enough. Tell
Syrio Forel that I want a word with hirn—”
He was interrupted by a short, sudden knock. “Lord Eddard, pardons,” Desmond called
out, opening the door a crack, “but there’s a black brother here begging audience. He

says the matter is urgent. I thought you would want to know.”
“My door is always open to the Night’s Watch,” Father said.
Desmond ushered the man inside. He was stooped and ugly, with an unkempt beard and
unwashed clothes, yet Father greeted him pleasantly and asked his name.
“Yoren, as it please m’lord. My pardons for the hour.” He bowed to Arya. “And this must
be your son. He has your look.”
“I’m a girl,” Arya said, exasperated. If the old man was down from the Wall, he must
have come by way of Winterfell. “Do you know my brothers?” she asked excitedly. “Robb
and Bran are at Winterfell, and Jon’s on the Wall. Jon Snow, he’s in the Night’s Watch
too, you must know him, he has a direwolf, a white one with red eyes. Is Jon a ranger
yet? I’m Arya Stark.” The old man in his smelly black clothes was looking at her oddly,
but Arya could not seem to stop talking. “When you ride back to the Wall, would you
bring Jon a letter if I wrote one?” She wished Jon were here right now. He’d believe her
about the dungeons and the fat man with the forked beard and the wizard in the steel
cap.
“My daughter often forgets her courtesies,” Eddard Stark said with a faint smile that
softened his words. “I beg your forgiveness, Yoren. Did my brother Benjen send you?”
“No one sent me, m’lord, saving old Mormont. I’m here to find men for the Wall, and
when Robert next holds court, I’ll bend the knee and cry our need, see if the king and his
Hand have some scum in the dungeons they’d be well rid of. You might say as Benjen
Stark is why we’re talking, though. His blood ran black. Made him my brother as much
as yours. It’s for his sake I’m come. Rode hard, I did, near killed my horse the way I
drove her, but I left the others well behind.”
“The others?”
Yoren spat. “Sellswords and freeriders and like trash. That inn was full o’ them, and I
saw them take the scent. The scent of blood or the scent of gold, they smell the same in
the end. Not all o’ them made for King’s Landing, either. Some went galloping for
Casterly Rock, and the Rock lies closer. Lord Tywin will have gotten the word by now,
you can count on it.”
Father frowned. “What word is this?”
Yoren eyed Arya. “One best spoken in private, m’lord, begging your pardons.”

“As you say. Desmond, see my daughter to her chambers.” He kissed her on the brow.
“We’ll finish our talk on the morrow.”
Arya stood rooted to the spot. “Nothing bad’s happened to Jon, has it?” she asked Yoren.
“Or Uncle Benjen?”
“Well, as to Stark, I can’t say. The Snow boy was well enough when I left the Wall. It’s
not them as concerns me.”
Desmond took her hand. “Come along, milady. You heard your lord father.”
Arya had no choice but to go with him, wishing it had been Fat Tom. With Tom, she
might have been able to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what Yoren was
saying, but Desmond was too single-minded to trick. “How many guards does my father
have?” she asked him as they descended to her bedchamber.
“Here at King’s Landing? Fifty.”
“You wouldn’t let anyone kill him, would you?” she asked.
Desmond laughed. “No fear on that count, little lady. Lord Eddard’s guarded night and
day. He’ll come to no harm.”
“The Lannisters have more than fifty men,” Arya pointed out.
“So they do, but every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords, so you can sleep
easy.”
“What if a wizard was sent to kill him?”
“Well, as to that,” Desmond replied, drawing his longsword, “wizards die the same as
other men, once you cut their heads off.”

EDDARD
Robert, I beg of you,” Ned pleaded, “hear what you are saying. You are talking of
murdering a child.”
“The whore is pregnant!” The king’s fist slammed down on the council table loud as a
thunderclap. “I warned you this would happen, Ned. Back in the barrowlands, I warned
you, but you did not care to hear it. Well, you’ll hear it now. I want them dead, mother
and child both, and that fool Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them
dead.”
The other councillors were all doing their best to pretend that they were somewhere else.
No doubt they were wiser than he was. Eddard Stark had seldom felt quite so alone.
“You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.”
“Then let it be on my head, so long as it is done. I am not so blind that I cannot see the
shadow of the axe when it is hanging over my own neck.”
“There is no axe,” Ned told his king. “Only the shadow of a shadow, twenty years
removed . . . if it exists at all.”
“If?” Varys asked softly, wringing powdered hands together. “My lord, you wrong me.
Would I bring ties to king and council?”
Ned looked at the eunuch coldly. “You would bring us the whisperings of a traitor half a
world away, my lord. Perhaps Mormont is wrong. Perhaps he is lying.”
“Ser Jorah would not dare deceive me,” Varys said with a sly smile. “Rely on it, my lord.
The princess is with child.”
“So you say. If you are wrong, we need not fear. If the girl miscarries, we need not fear. If
she births a daughter in place of a son, we need not fear. If the babe dies in infancy, we
need not fear.”
“But if it is a boy?” Robert insisted. “If he lives?”
“The narrow sea would still lie between us. I shall fear the Dothraki the day they teach

their horses to run on water.”
The king took a swallow of wine and glowered at Ned across the council table. “So you
would counsel me to do nothing until the dragonspawn has landed his army on my
shores, is that it?”
“This ‘dragonspawn’ is in his mother’s belly,” Ned said. “Even Aegon did no conquering
until after he was weaned.”
“Gods! You are stubborn as an aurochs, Stark.” The king looked around the council
table. “Have the rest of you mislaid your tongues? Will no one talk sense to this frozenfaced fool?”
Varys gave the king an unctuous smile and laid a soft hand on Ned’s sleeve. “I
understand your qualms, Lord Eddard, truly I do. It gave me no joy to bring this
grievous news to council. It is a terrible thing we contemplate, a vile thing. Yet we who
presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm, howevermuch it pains us.”
Lord Renly shrugged. “The matter seems simple enough to me. We ought to have had
Viserys and his sister killed years ago, but His Grace my brother made the mistake of
listening to Jon Arryn.”
“Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly,” Ned replied. “On the Trident, Ser Barristan here
cut down a dozen good men, Robert’s friends and mine. When they brought him to us,
grievously wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat, but your
brother said, ‘I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well,’ and sent his own
maester to tend Ser Barristan’s wounds.” He gave the king a long cool look. “Would that
man were here today.”
Robert had shame enough to blush. “It was not the same,” he complained. “Ser Barristan
was a knight of the Kingsguard.”
“Whereas Daenerys is a fourteen-year-old girl.” Ned knew he was pushing this well past
the point of wisdom, yet he could not keep silent. “Robert, I ask you, what did we rise
against Aerys Targaryen for, if not to put an end to the murder of children?”
“To put an end to Targaryens!” the king growled.
“Your Grace, I never knew you to fear Rhaegar.” Ned fought to keep the scorn out of his
voice, and failed. “Have the years so unmanned you that you tremble at the shadow of an
unborn child?”

Robert purpled. “No more, Ned,” he warned, pointing. “Not another word. Have you
forgotten who is king here?”
“No, Your Grace,” Ned replied. “Have you?”
“Enough!” the king bellowed. “I am sick of talk. I’ll be done with this, or be damned.
What say you all?”
“She must be killed,” Lord Renly declared.
“We have no choice,” murmured Varys. “Sadly, sadly . . . ”
Ser Barristan Selmy raised his pale blue eyes from the table and said, “Your Grace, there
is honor in facing an enemy on the battlefield, but none in killing him in his mother’s
womb. Forgive me, but I must stand with Lord Eddard.”
Grand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat, a process that seemed to take some minutes.
“My order serves the realm, not the ruler. Once I counseled King Aerys as loyally as I
counsel King Robert now, so I bear this girl child of his no ill will. Yet I ask you this—
should war come again, how many soldiers will die? How many towns will burn? How
many children will be ripped from their mothers to perish on the end of a spear?” He
stroked his luxuriant white beard, infinitely sad, infinitely weary. “Is it not wiser, even
kinder, that Daenerys Targaryen should die now so that tens of thousands might live?”
“Kinder,” Varys said. “Oh, well and truly spoken, Grand Maester. It is so true. Should the
gods in their caprice grant Daenerys Targaryen a son, the realm must bleed.”
Littlefinger was the last. As Ned looked to him, Lord Petyr stifled a yawn. “When you
find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, the best thing to do is close your eyes and get
on with it,” he declared. “Waiting won’t make the maid any prettier. Kiss her and be
done with it.”
“Kiss her?” Ser Barristan repeated, aghast.
“A steel kiss,” said Littlefinger.
Robert turned to face his Hand. “Well, there it is, Ned. You and Selmy stand alone on
this matter. The only question that remains is, who can we find to kill her?”
“Mormont craves a royal pardon,” Lord Renly reminded them.

“Desperately,” Varys said, “yet he craves life even more. By now, the princess nears Vaes
Dothrak, where it is death to draw a blade. If I told you what the Dothraki would do to
the poor man who used one on a khaleesi, none of you would sleep tonight.” He stroked
a powdered cheek. “Now, poison . . . the tears of Lys, let us say. Khal Drogo need never
know it was not a natural death.”
Grand Maester Pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open. He squinted suspiciously at the
eunuch.
“Poison is a coward’s weapon,” the king complained.
Ned had heard enough. “You send hired knives to kill a fourteen-year-old girl and still
quibble about honor?” He pushed back his chair and stood. “Do it yourself, Robert. The
man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. Look her in the eyes before you
kill her. See her tears, hear her last words. You owe her that much at least.”
“Gods,” the king swore, the word exploding out of him as if he could barely contain his
fury. “You mean it, damn you.” He reached for the flagon of wine at his elbow, found it
empty, and flung it away to shatter against the wall. “I am out of wine and out of
patience. Enough of this. Just have it done.”
“I will not be part of murder, Robert. Do as you will, but do not ask me to fix my seal to
it.”
For a moment Robert did not seem to understand what Ned was saying. Defiance was
not a dish he tasted often. Slowly his face changed as comprehension came. His eyes
narrowed and a flush crept up his neck past the velvet collar. He pointed an angry finger
at Ned. “You are the King’s Hand, Lord Stark. You will do as I command you, or I’ll find
me a Hand who will.”
“I wish him every success.” Ned unfastened the heavy clasp that clutched at the folds of
his cloak, the ornate silver hand that was his badge of office. He laid it on the table in
front of the king, saddened by the memory of the man who had pinned it on him, the
friend he had loved. “I thought you a better man than this, Robert. I thought we had
made a nobler king.”
Robert’s face was purple. “Out,” he croaked, choking on his rage. “Out, damn you, I’m
done with you. What are you waiting for? Go, run back to Winterfell. And make certain I
never look on your face again, or I swear, I’ll have your head on a spike!”
Ned bowed, and turned on his heel without another word. He could feel Robert’s eyes on
his back. As he strode from the council chambers, the discussion resumed with scarcely

a pause. “On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless Men,” Grand Maester Pycelle
offered.
“Do you have any idea how costly they are?” Littlefinger complained. “You could hire an
army of common sellswords for half the price, and that’s for a merchant. I don’t dare
think what they might ask for a princess.”
The closing of the door behind him silenced the voices. Ser Boros Blount was stationed
outside the chamber, wearing the long white cloak and armor of the Kingsguard. He
gave Ned a quick, curious glance from the corner of his eye, but asked no questions.
The day felt heavy and oppressive as he crossed the bailey back to the Tower of the
Hand. He could feel the threat of rain in the air. Ned would have welcomed it. It might
have made him feel a trifle less unclean. When he reached his solar, he summoned
Vayon Poole. The steward came at once. “You sent for me, my lord Hand?”
“Hand no longer,” Ned told him. “The king and I have quarreled. We shall be returning
to Winterfell.”
“I shall begin making arrangements at once, my lord. We will need a fortnight to ready
everything for the journey.”
“We may not have a fortnight. We may not have a day. The king mentioned something
about seeing my head on a spike.” Ned frowned. He did not truly believe the king would
harm him, not Robert. He was angry now, but once Ned was safely out of sight, his rage
would cool as it always did.
Always? Suddenly, uncomfortably, he found himself recalling Rhaegar Targaryen.
Fifteen years dead, yet Robert hates him as much as ever. It was a disturbing
notion . . . and there was the other matter, the business with Catelyn and the dwarf that
Yoren had warned him of last night. That would come to light soon, as sure as sunrise,
and with the king in such a black fury . . . Robert might not care a fig for Tyrion
Lannister, but it would touch on his pride, and there was no telling what the queen
might do.
“It might be safest if I went on ahead,” he told Poole. “I will take my daughters and a few
guardsmen. The rest of you can follow when you are ready. Inform Jory, but tell no one
else, and do nothing until the girls and I have gone. The castle is full of eyes and ears,
and I would rather my plans were not known.”
“As you command, my lord.”

When he had gone, Eddard Stark went to the window and sat brooding. Robert had left
him no choice that he could see. He ought to thank him. It would be good to return to
Winterfell. He ought never have left. His sons were waiting there. Perhaps he and
Catelyn would make a new son together when he returned, they were not so old yet. And
of late he had often found himself dreaming of snow, of the deep quiet of the wolfswood
at night.
And yet, the thought of leaving angered him as well. So much was still undone. Robert
and his council of cravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if left unchecked . . . or,
worse, sell it to the Lannisters in payment of their loans. And the truth of Jon Arryn’s
death still eluded him. Oh, he had found a few pieces, enough to convince him that Jon
had indeed been murdered, but that was no more than the spoor of an animal on the
forest floor. He had not sighted the beast itself yet, though he sensed it was there,
lurking, hidden, treacherous.
It struck him suddenly that he might return to Winterfell by sea. Ned was no sailor, and
ordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad, but if he took ship he could stop at
Dragonstone and speak with Stannis Baratheon. Pycelle had sent a raven off across the
water, with a polite letter from Ned requesting Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the
small council. As yet, there had been no reply, but the silence only deepened his
suspicions. Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for, he was certain of it.
The truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the ancient island fortress of
House Targaryen.
And when you have it, what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are
too dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust. Ned slid the dagger that
Catelyn had brought him out of the sheath on his belt. The Imp’s knife. Why would the
dwarf want Bran dead? To silence him, surely. Another secret, or only a different strand
of the same web?
Could Robert be part of it? He would not have thought so, but once he would not have
thought Robert could command the murder of women and children either. Catelyn had
tried to warn him. You knew the man, she had said. The king is a stranger to you. The
sooner he was quit of King’s Landing, the better. If there was a ship sailing north on the
morrow, it would be well to be on it.
He summoned Vayon Poole again and sent him to the docks to make inquiries, quietly
but quickly. “Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain,” he told the steward. “I care
nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments, so long as it is swift
and safe. I wish to leave at once.”
Poole had no sooner taken his leave than Tomard announced a visitor. “Lord Baelish to

see you, m’lord.”
Ned was half-tempted to turn him away, but thought better of it. He was not free yet;
until he was, he must play their games. “Show him in, Tom.”
Lord Petyr sauntered into the solar as if nothing had gone amiss that morning. He wore
a slashed velvet doublet in cream-and-silver, a grey silk cloak trimmed with black fox,
and his customary mocking smile.
Ned greeted him coldly. “Might I ask the reason for this visit, Lord Baelish?”
“I won’t detain you long, I’m on my way to dine with Lady Tanda. Lamprey pie and roast
suckling pig. She has some thought to wed me to her younger daughter, so her table is
always astonishing. If truth be told, I’d sooner marry the pig, but don’t tell her. I do love
lamprey pie.”
“Don’t let me keep you from your eels, my lord,” Ned said with icy disdain. “At the
moment, I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours.”
“Oh, I’m certain if you put your mind to it, you could come up with a few names. Varys,
say. Cersei. Or Robert. His Grace is most wroth with you. He went on about you at some
length after you took your leave of us this morning. The words insolence and ingratitude
came into it frequently, I seem to recall.”
Ned did not honor that with a reply. Nor did he offer his guest a seat, but Littlefinger
took one anyway. “After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire
the Faceless Men,” he continued blithely. “Instead Varys will quietly let it be known that
we’ll make a lord of whoever does in the Targaryen girl.”
Ned was disgusted. “So now we grant titles to assassins.”
Littlefinger shrugged. “Titles are cheap. The Faceless Men are expensive. If truth be told,
I did the Targaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of honor. Let some
sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill her. Likely he’ll make a botch of it, and
afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard. If we’d sent a Faceless Man after her,
she’d be as good as buried.”
Ned frowned. “You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses, and now you
expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl? How big a fool do you take me
for?”
“Well, quite an enormous one, actually,” said Littlefinger, laughing.

“Do you always find murder so amusing, Lord Baelish?”
“It’s not murder I find amusing, Lord Stark, it’s you. You rule like a man dancing on
rotten ice. I daresay you will make a noble splash. I believe I heard the first crack this
morning.”
“The first and last,” said Ned. “I’ve had my fill.”
“When do you mean to return to Winterfell, my lord?”
“As soon as I can. What concern is that of yours?”
“None . . . but if perchance you’re still here come evenfall, I’d be pleased to take you to
this brothel your man Jory has been searching for so ineffectually.” Littlefinger smiled.
“And I won’t even tell the Lady Catelyn.”

CATELYN
My lady, you should have sent word of your coming,” Ser Donnel Waynwood told her as
their horses climbed the pass. “We would have sent an escort. The high road is not as
safe as it once was, for a party as small as yours.”
“We learned that to our sorrow, Ser Donnel,” Catelyn said. Sometimes she felt as though
her heart had turned to stone; six brave men had died to bring her this far, and she could
not even find it in her to weep for them. Even their names were fading. “The clansmen
harried us day and night. We lost three men in the first attack, and two more in the
second, and Lannister’s serving man died of a fever when his wounds festered. When we
heard your men approaching, I thought us doomed for certain.” They had drawn up for a
last desperate fight, blades in hand and backs to the rock. The dwarf had been whetting
the edge of his axe and making some mordant jest when Bronn spotted the banner the
riders carried before them, the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky-blue and white.
Catelyn had never seen a more welcome sight.
“The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died,” Ser Donnel said. He was a stocky
youth of twenty years, earnest and homely, with a wide nose and a shock of thick brown
hair. “If it were up to me, I would take a hundred men into the mountains, root them out
of their fastnesses, and teach them some sharp lessons, but your sister has forbidden it.
She would not even permit her knights to fight in the Hand’s tourney. She wants all our
swords kept close to home, to defend the Vale . . . against what, no one is certain.
Shadows, some say.” He looked at her anxiously, as if he had suddenly remembered who
she was. “I hope I have not spoken out of turn, my lady. I meant no offense.”
“Frank talk does not offend me, Ser Donnel.” Catelyn knew what her sister feared. Not
shadows, Lannisters, she thought to herself, glancing back to where the dwarf rode
beside Bronn. The two of them had grown thick as thieves since Chiggen had died. The
little man was more cunning than she liked. When they had entered the mountains, he
had been her captive, bound and helpless. What was he now? Her captive still, yet he
rode along with a dirk through his belt and an axe strapped to his saddle, wearing the
shadowskin cloak he’d won dicing with the singer and the chainmail hauberk he’d taken
off Chiggen’s corpse. Two score men flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band,
knights and men-at-arms in service to her sister Lysa and Jon Arryn’s young son, and
yet Tyrion betrayed no hint of fear. Could I be wrong? Catelyn wondered, not for the
first time. Could he be innocent after all, of Bran and Jon Arryn and all the rest? And if
he was, what did that make her? Six men had died to bring him here.

Resolute, she pushed her doubts away. “When we reach your keep, I would take it kindly
if you could send for Maester Colemon at once. Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds.”
More than once she had feared the gallant old knight would not survive the journey.
Toward the end he could scarcely sit his horse, and Bronn had urged her to leave him to
his fate, but Catelyn would not hear of it. They had tied him in the saddle instead, and
she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch over him.
Ser Donnel hesitated before he answered. “The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester
to remain at the Eyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert,” he said. “We have a septon at
the gate who tends to our wounded. He can see to your man’s hurts.”
Catelyn had more faith in a maester’s learning than a septon’s prayers. She was about to
say as much when she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone
of the mountains on either side of them. Where the pass shrank to a narrow defile scarce
wide enough for four men to ride abreast, twin watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes,
joined by a covered bridge of weathered grey stone that arched above the road. Silent
faces watched from arrow slits in tower, battlements, and bridge. When they had
climbed almost to the top, a knight rode out to meet them. His horse and his armor were
grey, but his cloak was the rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun, and a shiny black fish,
wrought in gold and obsidian, pinned its folds against his shoulder. “Who would pass
the Bloody Gate?” he called.
“Ser Donnel Waynwood, with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions,” the young
knight answered.
The Knight of the Gate lifted his visor. “I thought the lady looked familiar. You are far
from home, little Cat.”
“And you, Uncle,” she said, smiling despite all she had been through. Hearing that
hoarse, smoky voice again took her back twenty years, to the days of her childhood.
“My home is at my back,” he said gruffly.
“Your home is in my heart,” Catelyn told him. “Take off your helm. I would look on your
face again.”
“The years have not improved it, I fear,” Brynden Tully said, but when he lifted off the
helm, Catelyn saw that he lied. His features were lined and weathered, and time had
stolen the auburn from his hair and left him only grey, but the smile was the same, and
the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars, and the laughter in his deep blue eyes. “Did Lysa
know you were coming?”

“There was no time to send word ahead,” Catelyn told him. The others were coming up
behind her. “I fear we ride before the storm, Uncle.”
“May we enter the Vale?” Ser Donnel asked. The Waynwoods were ever ones for
ceremony.
“In the name of Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, True Warden of
the East, I bid you enter freely, and charge you to keep his peace,” Ser Brynden replied.
“Come.”
And so she rode behind him, beneath the shadow of the Bloody Gate where a dozen
armies had dashed themselves to pieces in the Age of Heroes. On the far side of the
stoneworks, the mountains opened up suddenly upon a vista of green fields, blue sky,
and snowcapped mountains that took her breath away. The Vale of Arryn bathed in the
morning light.
It stretched before them to the misty cast, a tranquil land of rich black soil, wide slowmoving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the sun, protected
on all sides by its sheltering peaks. Wheat and corn and barley grew high in its fields,
and even in Highgarden the pumpkins were no larger nor the fruit any sweeter than
here. They stood at the western end of the valley, where the high road crested the last
pass and began its winding descent to the bottomlands two miles below. The Vale was
narrow here, no more than a half day’s ride across, and the northern mountains seemed
so close that Catelyn could almost reach out and touch them. Looming over them all was
the jagged peak called the Giant’s Lance, a mountain that even mountains looked up to,
its head lost in icy mists three and a half miles above the valley floor. Over its massive
western shoulder flowed the ghost torrent of Alyssa’s Tears. Even from this distance,
Catelyn could make out the shining silver thread, bright against the dark stone.
When her uncle saw that she had stopped, he moved his horse closer and pointed. “It’s
there, beside Alyssa’s Tears. All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and
then, if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right.”
Seven towers, Ned had told her, like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky, so
high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds. “How long a ride?”
she asked.
“We can be at the mountain by evenfall,” Uncle Brynden said, “but the climb will take
another day.”
Ser Rodrik Cassel spoke up from behind. “My lady,” he said, “I fear I can go no farther

today.” His face sagged beneath his ragged, newgrown whiskers, and he looked so weary
Catelyn feared he might fall off his horse.
“Nor should you,” she said. “You have done all I could have asked of you, and a hundred
times more. My uncle will see me the rest of the way to the Eyrie. Lannister must come
with me, but there is no reason that you and the others should not rest here and recover
your strength.”
“We should be honored to have them to guest,” Ser Donnel said with the grave courtesy
of the young. Beside Ser Rodrik, only Bronn, Ser Willis Wode, and Marillion the singer
remained of the party that had ridden with her from the inn by the crossroads.
“My lady,” Marillion said, riding forward. “I beg you allow me to accompany you to the
Eyrie, to see the end of the tale as I saw its beginnings.” The boy sounded haggard, yet
strangely determined; he had a fevered shine to his eyes.
Catelyn had never asked the singer to ride with them; that choice he had made himself,
and how he had come to survive the journey when so many braver men lay dead and
unburied behind them, she could never say. Yet here he was, with a scruff of beard that
made him look almost a man. Perhaps she owed him something for having come this far.
“Very well,” she told him.
“I’ll come as well,” Bronn announced.
She liked that less well. Without Bronn she would never have reached the Vale, she
knew; the sellsword was as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen, and his sword had
helped cut them through to safety. Yet for all that, Catelyn misliked the man. Courage he
had, and strength, but there was no kindness in him, and little loyalty. And she had seen
him riding beside Lannister far too often, talking in low voices and laughing at some
private joke. She would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now,
but having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie, she could see no gracious
way to deny that same right to Bronn. “As you wish,” she said, although she noted that
he had not actually asked her permission.
Ser Willis Wode remained with Ser Rodrik, a soft-spoken septon fussing over their
wounds. Their horses were left behind as well, poor ragged things. Ser Donnel promised
to send birds ahead to the Eyrie and the Gates of the Moon with the word of their
coming. Fresh mounts were brought forth from the stables, surefooted mountain stock
with shaggy coats, and within the hour they set forth once again. Catelyn rode beside her
uncle as they began the descent to the valley floor. Behind came Bronn, Tyrion
Lannister, Marillion, and six of Brynden’s men.

Not until they were a third of the way down the mountain path, well out of earshot of the
others, did Brynden Tully turn to her and say, “So, child. Tell me about this storm of
yours.”
“I have not been a child in many years, Uncle,” Catelyn said, but she told him
nonetheless. It took longer than she would have believed to tell it all, Lysa’s letter and
Bran’s fall, the assassin’s dagger and Littlefinger and her chance meeting with Tyrion
Lannister in the crossroads inn.
Her uncle listened silently, heavy brows shadowing his eyes as his frown grew deeper.
Brynden Tully had always known how to listen . . . to anyone but her father. He was Lord
Hoster’s brother, younger by five years, but the two of them had been at war as far back
as Catelyn could remember. During one of their louder quarrels, when Catelyn was
eight, Lord Hoster had called Brynden “the black goat of the Tully flock.” Laughing,
Brynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a leaping trout, so he ought to
be a black fish rather than a black goat, and from that day forward he had taken it as his
personal emblem.
The war had not ended until the day she and Lysa had been wed. It was at their wedding
feast that Brynden told his brother he was leaving Riverrun to serve Lysa and her new
husband, the Lord of the Eyrie. Lord Hoster had not spoken his brother’s name since,
from what Edmure told her in his infrequent letters.
Nonetheless, during all those years of Catelyn’s girlhood, it had been Brynden the
Blackfish to whom Lord Hoster’s children had run with their tears and their tales, when
Father was too busy and Mother too ill. Catelyn, Lysa, Edmure . . . and yes, even Petyr
Baelish, their father’s ward . . . he had listened to them all patiently, as he listened now,
laughing at their triumphs and sympathizing with their childish misfortunes.
When she was done, her uncle remained silent for a long time, as his horse negotiated
the steep, rocky trail. “Your father must be told,” he said at last. “If the Lannisters should
march, Winterfell is remote and the Vale walled up behind its mountains, but Riverrun
lies right in their path.”
“I’d had the same fear,” Catelyn admitted. “I shall ask Maester Colemon to send a bird
when we reach the Eyrie.” She had other messages to send as well; the commands that
Ned had given her for his bannermen, to ready the defenses of the north. “What is the
mood in the Vale?” she asked.
“Angry,” Brynden Tully admitted. “Lord Jon was much loved, and the insult was keenly
felt when the king named Jaime Lannister to an office the Arryns had held for near three
hundred years. Lysa has commanded us to call her son the True Warden of the East, but

no one is fooled. Nor is your sister alone in wondering at the manner of the Hand’s
death. None dare say Jon was murdered, not openly, but suspicion casts a long shadow.”
He gave Catelyn a look, his mouth tight. “And there is the boy.”
“The boy? What of him?” She ducked her head as they passed under a low overhang of
rock, and around a sharp turn.
Her uncle’s voice was troubled. “Lord Robert,” he sighed. “Six years old, sickly, and
prone to weep if you take his dolls away. Jon Arryn’s trueborn heir, by all the gods, yet
there are some who say he is too weak to sit his father’s seat, Nestor Royce has been high
steward these past fourteen years, while Lord Jon served in King’s Landing, and many
whisper that he should rule until the boy comes of age. Others believe that Lysa must
marry again, and soon. Already the suitors gather like crows on a battlefield. The Eyrie is
full of them.”
“I might have expected that,” Catelyn said. Small wonder there; Lysa was still young, and
the kingdom of Mountain and Vale made a handsome wedding gift. “Will Lysa take
another husband?”
“She says yes, provided she finds a man who suits her,” Brynden Tully said, “but she has
already rejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men. She swears that this time
she will choose her lord husband.”
“You of all people can scarce fault her for that.”
Ser Brynden snorted. “Nor do I, but . . . it seems to me Lysa is only playing at courtship.
She enjoys the sport, but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until her boy is old
enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name.”
“A woman can rule as wisely as a man,” Catelyn said.
“The right woman can,” her uncle said with a sideways glance. “Make no mistake, Cat.
Lysa is not you.” He hesitated a moment. “If truth be told, I fear you may not find your
sister as helpful as you would like.”
She was puzzled. “What do you mean?”
“The Lysa who came back from King’s Landing is not the same girl who went south when
her husband was named Hand. Those years were hard for her. You must know. Lord
Arryn was a dutiful husband, but their marriage was made from politics, not passion.”
“As was my own.”

“They began the same, but your ending has been happier than your sister’s. Two babes
stillborn, twice as many miscarriages, Lord Arryn’s death . . . Catelyn, the gods gave Lysa
only the one child, and he is all your sister lives for now, poor boy. Small wonder she fled
rather than see him handed over to the Lannisters. Your sister is afraid, child, and the
Lannisters are what she fears most. She ran to the Vale, stealing away from the Red Keep
like a thief in the night, and all to snatch her son out of the lion’s mouth . . . and now you
have brought the lion to her door.”
“In chains,” Catelyn said. A crevasse yawned on her right, falling away into darkness.
She reined up her horse and picked her way along step by careful step.
“Oh?” Her uncle glanced back, to where Tyrion Lannister was making his slow descent
behind them. “I see an axe on his saddle, a dirk at his belt, and a sellsword that trails
after him like a hungry shadow. Where are the chains, sweet one?”
Catelyn shifted uneasily in her seat. “The dwarf is here, and not by choice. Chains or no,
he is my prisoner. Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than I. It was her
own lord husband the Lannisters murdered, and her own letter that first warned us
against them.”
Brynden Blackfish gave her a weary smile. “I hope you are right, child,” he sighed, in
tones that said she was wrong.
The sun was well to the west by the time the slope began to flatten beneath the hooves of
their horses. The road widened and grew straight, and for the first time Catelyn noticed
wildflowers and grasses growing. Once they reached the valley floor, the going was faster
and they made good time, cantering through verdant greenwoods and sleepy little
hamlets, past orchards and golden wheat fields, splashing across a dozen sunlit streams.
Her uncle sent a standard-bearer ahead of them, a double banner flying from his staff;
the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn on high, and below it his own black fish. Farm
wagons and merchants’ carts and riders from lesser houses moved aside to let them pass.
Even so, it was full dark before they reached the stout castle that stood at the foot of the
Giant’s Lance. Torches flickered atop its ramparts, and the horned moon danced upon
the dark waters of its moat. The drawbridge was up and the portcullis down, but Catelyn
saw lights burning in the gatehouse and spilling from the windows of the square towers
beyond.
“The Gates of the Moon,” her uncle said as the party drew rein. His standard-bearer rode
to the edge of the moat to hail the men in the gatehouse. “Lord Nestor’s seat. He should
be expecting us. Look up.”

Catelyn raised her eyes, up and up and up. At first all she saw was stone and trees, the
looming mass of the great mountain shrouded in night, as black as a starless sky. Then
she noticed the glow of distant fires well above them; a tower keep, built upon the steep
side of the mountain, its lights like orange eyes staring down from above. Above that was
another, higher and more distant, and still higher a third, no more than a flickering
spark in the sky. And finally, up where the falcons soared, a flash of white in the
moonlight. Vertigo washed over her as she stared upward at the pale towers, so far
above.
“The Eyrie,” she heard Marillion murmur, awed.
The sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in. “The Arryns must not be overfond of
company. If you’re planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark, I’d rather you
kill me here.”
“We’ll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow,” Brynden told him.
“I can scarcely wait,” the dwarf replied. “How do we get up there? I’ve no experience at
riding goats.”
“Mules,” Brynden said, smiling.
“There are steps carved into the mountain,” Catelyn said. Ned had told her about them
when he talked of his youth here with Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn.
Her uncle nodded. “It is too dark to see them, but the steps are there. Too steep and
narrow for horses, but mules can manage them most of the way. The path is guarded by
three waycastles, Stone and Snow and Sky. The mules will take us as far up as Sky.”
Tyrion Lannister glanced up doubtfully. “And beyond that?”
Brynden smiled. “Beyond that, the path is too steep even for mules. We ascend on foot
the rest of the way. Or perchance you’d prefer to ride a basket. The Eyrie clings to the
mountain directly above Sky, and in its cellars are six great winches with long iron
chains to draw supplies up from below. If you prefer, my lord of Lannister, I can arrange
for you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples.”
The dwarf gave a bark of laughter. “Would that I were a pumpkin,” he said. “Alas, my
lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like
a load of turnips. If you ascend on foot, I fear I must do the same. We Lannisters do have
a certain pride.”

“Pride?” Catelyn snapped. His mocking tone and easy manner made her angry.
“Arrogance, some might call it. Arrogance and avarice and lust for power.”
“My brother is undoubtedly arrogant,” Tyrion Lannister replied. “My father is the soul of
avarice, and my sweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking breath. I, however,
am innocent as a little lamb. Shall I bleat for you?” He grinned.
The drawbridge came creaking down before she could reply, and they heard the sound of
oiled chains as the portcullis was drawn up. Men-at-arms carried burning brands out to
light their way, and her uncle led them across the moat. Lord Nestor Royce, High
Steward of the Vale and Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, was waiting in the yard to
greet them, surrounded by his knights. “Lady Stark,” he said, bowing. He was a massive,
barrel-chested man, and his bow was clumsy.
Catelyn dismounted to stand before him. “Lord Nestor,” she said. She knew the man
only by reputation; Bronze Yohn’s cousin, from a lesser branch of House Royce, yet still
a formidable lord in his own right. “We have had a long and tiring journey. I would beg
the hospitality of your roof tonight, if I might.”
“My roof is yours, my lady,” Lord Nestor returned gruffly, “but your sister the Lady Lysa
has sent down word from the Eyrie. She wishes to see you at once. The rest of your party
will be housed here and sent up at first light.”
Her uncle swung off his horse. “What madness is this?” he said bluntly. Brynden Tully
had never been a man to blunt the edge of his words. “A night ascent, with the moon not
even full? Even Lysa should know that’s an invitation to a broken neck.”
“The mules know the way, Ser Brynden.” A wiry girl of seventeen or eighteen years
stepped up beside Lord Nestor. Her dark hair was cropped short and straight around her
head, and she wore riding leathers and a light shirt of silvered ringmail. She bowed to
Catelyn, more gracefully than her lord. “I promise you, my lady, no harm will come to
you. It would be my honor to take you up. I’ve made the dark climb a hundred times.
Mychel says my father must have been a goat.”
She sounded so cocky that Catelyn had to smile. “Do you have a name, child?”
“Mya Stone, if it please you, my lady,” the girl said.
It did not please her; it was an effort for Catelyn to keep the smile on her face. Stone was
a bastard’s name in the Vale, as Snow was in the north, and Flowers in Highgarden; in
each of the Seven Kingdoms, custom had fashioned a surname for children born with no

names of their own. Catelyn had nothing against this girl, but suddenly she could not
help but think of Ned’s bastard on the Wall, and the thought made her angry and guilty,
both at once. She struggled to find words for a reply.
Lord Nestor filled the silence. “Mya’s a clever girl, and if she vows she will bring you
safely to the Lady Lysa, I believe her. She has not failed me yet.”
“Then I put myself in your hands, Mya Stone,” Catelyn said. “Lord Nestor, I charge you
to keep a close guard on my prisoner.”
“And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon, before
he dies of hunger,” Lannister said. “A girl would be pleasant as well, but I suppose that’s
too much to ask of you.” The sellsword Bronn laughed aloud.
Lord Nestor ignored the banter. “As you say, my lady, so it will be done.” Only then did
he look at the dwarf. “See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell, and bring him meat and
mead.”
Catelyn took her leave of her uncle and the others as Tyrion Lannister was led off, then
followed the bastard girl through the castle. Two mules were waiting in the upper bailey,
saddled and ready. Mya helped her mount one while a guardsman in a sky-blue cloak
opened the narrow postern gate. Beyond was dense forest of pine and spruce, and the
mountain like a black wall, but the steps were there, chiseled deep into the rock,
ascending into the sky. “Some people find it easier if they close their eyes,” Mya said as
she led the mules through the gate into the dark wood. “When they get frightened or
dizzy, sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight. They don’t like that.”
“I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark,” Catelyn said. “I do not frighten easily. Do you
plan to light a torch?” The steps were black as pitch.
The girl made a face. “Torches just blind you. On a clear night like this, the moon and
the stars are enough. Mychel says I have the eyes of the owl.” She mounted and urged
her mule up the first step. Catelyn’s animal followed of its own accord.
“You mentioned Mychel before,” Catelyn said. The mules set the pace, slow but steady.
She was perfectly content with that.
“Mychel’s my love,” Mya explained. “Mychel Redfort. He’s squire to Ser Lyn Corbray.
We’re to wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after.”
She sounded so like Sansa, so happy and innocent with her dreams. Catelyn smiled, but
the smile was tinged with sadness. The Redforts were an old name in the Vale, she knew,

with the blood of the First Men in their veins. His love she might be, but no Redfort
would ever wed a bastard. His family would arrange a more suitable match for him, to a
Corbray or a Waynwood or a Royce, or perhaps a daughter of some greater house
outside the Vale. If Mychel Redfort laid with this girl at all, it would be on the wrong side
of the sheet.
The ascent was easier than Catelyn had dared hope. The trees pressed close, leaning over
the path to make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon, so it seemed as
though they were moving up a long black tunnel. But the mules were surefooted and
tireless, and Mya Stone did indeed seem blessed with night-eyes. They plodded upward,
winding their way back and forth across the face of the mountain as the steps twisted
and turned. A thick layer of fallen needles carpeted the path, so the shoes of their mules
made only the softest sound on the rock. The quiet soothed her, and the gentle rocking
motion set Catelyn to swaying in her saddle. Before long she was fighting sleep.
Perhaps she did doze for a moment, for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming
before them. “Stone,” Mya announced cheerily, dismounting. Iron spikes were set along
the tops of formidable stone walls, and two fat round towers overtopped the keep. The
gate swung open at Mya’s shout. Inside, the portly knight who commanded the
waycastle greeted Mya by name and offered them skewers of charred meat and onions
still hot from the spit. Catelyn had not realized how hungry she was. She ate standing in
the yard, as stablehands moved their saddles to fresh mules. The hot juices ran down her
chin and dripped onto her cloak, but she was too famished to care.
Then it was up onto a new mule and out again into the starlight. The second part of the
ascent seemed more treacherous to Catelyn. The trail was steeper, the steps more worn,
and here and there littered with pebbles and broken stone. Mya had to dismount a halfdozen times to move fallen rocks from their path. “You don’t want your mule to break a
leg up here,” she said. Catelyn was forced to agree. She could feel the altitude more now.
The trees were sparser up here, and the wind blew more vigorously, sharp gusts that
tugged at her clothing and pushed her hair into her eyes. From time to time the steps
doubled back on themselves, and she could see Stone below them, and the Gates of the
Moon farther down, its torches no brighter than candles.
Snow was smaller than Stone, a single fortified tower and a timber keep and stable
hidden behind a low wall of unmortared rock. Yet it nestled against the Giant’s Lance in
such a way as to command the entire stone stair above the lower waycastle. An enemy
intent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from Stone step by step, while rocks and
arrows rained down from Snow above. The commander, an anxious young knight with a
pockmarked face, offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves before
his fire, but Mya declined. “We ought to keep going, my lady,” she said. “If it please you.”
Catelyn nodded.

Again they were given fresh mules. Hers was white. Mya smiled when she saw him.
“Whitey’s a good one, my lady. Sure of foot, even on ice, but you need to be careful. He’ll
kick if he doesn’t like you.”
The white mule seemed to like Catelyn; there was no kicking, thank the gods. There was
no ice either, and she was grateful for that as well. “My mother says that hundreds of
years ago, this was where the snow began,” Mya told her. “It was always white above
here, and the ice never melted.” She shrugged. “I can’t remember ever seeing snow this
far down the mountain, but maybe it was that way once, in the olden times.”
So young, Catelyn thought, trying to remember if she had ever been like that. The girl
had lived half her life in summer, and that was all she knew. Winter is coming, child, she
wanted to tell her. The words were on her lips; she almost said them. Perhaps she was
becoming a Stark at last.
Above Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in the waste,
then falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency. The stars seemed brighter
up here, so close that she could almost touch them, and the horned moon was huge in
the clear black sky. As they climbed, Catelyn found it was better to look up than down.
The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze and thaw and the tread of
countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat. When they
came to a high saddle between two spires of rock, Mya dismounted. “It’s best to lead the
mules over,” she said. “The wind can be a little scary here, my lady.”
Catelyn climbed stiffly from the shadows and looked at the path ahead; twenty feet long
and close to three feet wide, but with a precipitous drop to either side. She could hear
the wind shrieking. Mya stepped lightly out, her mule following as calmly as if they were
crossing a bailey. It was her turn. Yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear
caught Catelyn in its jaws. She could feel the emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that
yawned around her. She stopped, trembling, afraid to move. The wind screamed at her
and wrenched at her cloak, trying to pull her over the edge. Catelyn edged her foot
backward, the most timid of steps, but the mule was behind her, and she could not
retreat. I am going to die here, she thought. She could feel cold sweat trickling down her
back.
“Lady Stark,” Mya called across the gulf. The girl sounded a thousand leagues away. “Are
you well?”
Catelyn Tully Stark swallowed what remained of her pride. “I . . . I cannot do this, child,”
she called out.
“Yes you can,” the bastard girl said. “I know you can. Look how wide the path is.”

“I don’t want to look.” The world seemed to be spinning around her, mountain and sky
and mules, whirling like a child’s top. Catelyn closed her eyes to steady her ragged
breathing.
“I’ll come back for you,” Mya said. “Don’t move, my lady.”
Moving was about the last thing Catelyn was about to do. She listened to the skirling of
the wind and the scuffling sound of leather on stone. Then Mya was there, taking her
gently by the arm. “Keep your eyes closed if you like. Let go of the rope now, Whitey will
take care of himself. Very good, my lady. I’ll lead you over, it’s easy, you’ll see. Give me a
step now. That’s it, move your foot, just slide it forward. See. Now another. Easy. You
could run across. Another one, go on. Yes.” And so, foot by foot, step by step, the bastard
girl led Catelyn across, blind and trembling, while the white mule followed placidly
behind them.
The waycastle called Sky was no more than a high, crescent-shaped wall of unmortared
stone raised against the side of the mountain, but even the topless towers of Valyria
could not have looked more beautiful to Catelyn Stark. Here at last the snow crown
began; Sky’s weathered stones were rimed with frost, and long spears of ice hung from
the slopes above.
Dawn was breaking in the east as Mya Stone hallooed for the guards, and the gates
opened before them. Inside the walls there was only a series of ramps and a great tumble
of boulders and stones of all sizes. No doubt it would be the easiest thing in the world to
begin an avalanche from here. A mouth yawned in the rock face in front of them. “The
stables and barracks are in there,” Mya said. “The last part is inside the mountain. It can
be a little dark, but at least you’re out of the wind. This is as far as the mules can go. Past
here, well, it’s a sort of chimney, more like a stone ladder than proper steps, but it’s not
too bad. Another hour and we’ll be there.”
Catelyn looked up. Directly overhead, pale in the dawn light, she could see the
foundations of the Eyrie. It could not be more than six hundred feet above them. From
below it looked like a small white honeycomb. She remembered what her uncle had said
of baskets and winches. “The Lannisters may have their pride,” she told Mya, “but the
Tullys are born with better sense. I have ridden all day and the best part of a night. Tell
them to lower a basket. I shall ride with the turnips.”
The sun was well above the mountains by the time Catelyn Stark finally reached the
Eyrie. A stocky, silver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered moon-and-falcon
breastplate helped her from the basket; Ser Vardis Egen, captain of Jon Arryn’s
household guard. Beside him stood Maester Colemon, thin and nervous, with too little
hair and too much neck. “Lady Stark,” Ser Vardis said, “the pleasure is as great as it is

unanticipated.” Maester Colemon bobbed his head in agreement. “Indeed it is, my lady,
indeed it is. I have sent word to your sister. She left orders to be awakened the instant
you arrived.”
“I hope she had a good night’s rest,” Catelyn said with a certain bite in her tone that
seemed to go unnoticed.
The men escorted her from the winch room up a spiral stair. The Eyrie was a small castle
by the standards of the great houses; seven slender white towers bunched as tightly as
arrows in a quiver on a shoulder of the great mountain. It had no need of stables nor
smithys nor kennels, but Ned said its granary was as large as Winterfell’s, and its towers
could house five hundred men. Yet it seemed strangely deserted to Catelyn as she passed
through it, its pale stone halls echoing and empty.
Lysa was waiting alone in her solar, still clad in her bed robes. Her long auburn hair
tumbled unbound across bare white shoulders and down her back. A maid stood behind
her, brushing out the night’s tangles, but when Catelyn entered, her sister rose to her
feet, smiling. “Cat,” she said. “Oh, Cat, how good it is to see you. My sweet sister.” She
ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her arms. “How long it has been,” Lysa
murmured against her. “Oh, how very very long.”
It had been five years, in truth; five cruel years, for Lysa. They had taken their toll. Her
sister was two years the younger, yet she looked older now. Shorter than Catelyn, Lysa
had grown thick of body, pale and puffy of face. She had the blue eyes of the Tullys, but
hers were pale and watery, never still. Her small mouth had turned petulant. As Catelyn
held her, she remembered the slender, high-breasted girl who’d waited beside her that
day in the sept at Riverrun. How lovely and full of hope she had been. All that remained
of her sister’s beauty was the great fall of thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist.
“You look well,” Catelyn lied, “but . . . tired.”
Her sister broke the embrace. “Tired. Yes. Oh, yes.” She seemed to notice the others
then; her maid, Maester Colemon, Ser Vardis. “Leave us,” she told them. “I wish to speak
to my sister alone.” She held Catelyn’s hand as they withdrew . . .
. . . and dropped it the instant the door closed. Catelyn saw her face change. It was as if
the sun had gone behind a cloud. “Have you taken leave of your senses?” Lysa snapped
at her. “To bring him here, without a word of permission, without so much as a warning,
to drag us into your quarrels with the Lannisters . . . ”
“My quarrels?” Catelyn could scarce believe what she was hearing. A great fire burned in
the hearth, but there was no trace of warmth in Lysa’s voice. “They were your quarrels

first, sister. It was you who sent me that cursed letter, you who wrote that the Lannisters
had murdered your husband.”
“To warn you, so you could stay away from them! I never meant to fight them! Gods,
Cat, do you know what you’ve done?”
“Mother?” a small voice said. Lysa whirled, her heavy robe swirling around her. Robert
Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, stood in the doorway, clutching a ragged cloth doll and looking
at them with large eyes. He was a painfully thin child, small for his age and sickly all his
days, and from time to time he trembled. The shaking sickness, the maesters called it. “I
heard voices.”
Small wonder, Catelyn thought; Lysa had almost been shouting. Still, her sister looked
daggers at her. “This is your aunt Catelyn, baby. My sister, Lady Stark. Do you
remember?”
The boy glanced at her blankly. “I think so,” he said, blinking, though he had been less
than a year old the last time Catelyn had seen him.
Lysa seated herself near the fire and said, “Come to Mother, my sweet one.” She
straightened his bedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair. “Isn’t he beautiful? And
strong too, don’t you believe the things you hear. Jon knew. The seed is strong, he told
me. His last words. He kept saying Robert’s name, and he grabbed my arm so hard he
left marks. Tell them, the seed is strong. His seed. He wanted everyone to know what a
good strong boy my baby was going to be.”
“Lysa,” Catelyn said, “if you’re right about the Lannisters, all the more reason we must
act quickly. We—”
“Not in front of the baby,” Lysa said. “He has a delicate temper, don’t you, sweet one?”
“The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale,” Catelyn reminded her, “and
these are no times for delicacy. Ned thinks it may come to war.”
“Quiet!” Lysa snapped at her. “You’re scaring the boy.” Little Robert took a quick peek
over his shoulder at Catelyn and began to tremble. His doll fell to the rushes, and he
pressed himself against his mother. “Don’t be afraid, my sweet baby,” Lysa whispered.
“Mother’s here, nothing will hurt you.” She opened her robe and drew out a pale, heavy
breast, tipped with red. The boy grabbed for it eagerly, buried his face against her chest,
and began to suck. Lysa stroked his hair.
Catelyn was at a loss for words. Jon Arryn’s son, she thought incredulously. She

remembered her own baby, three-year-old Rickon, half the age of this boy and five times
as fierce. Small wonder the lords of the Vale were restive. For the first time she
understood why the king had tried to take the child away from his mother to foster with
the Lannisters . . .
“We’re safe here,” Lysa was saying. Whether to her or to the boy, Catelyn was not sure.
“Don’t be a fool,” Catelyn said, the anger rising in her. “No one is safe. If you think
hiding here will make the Lannisters forget you, you are sadly mistaken.”
Lysa covered her boy’s ear with her hand. “Even if they could bring an army through the
mountains and past the Bloody Gate, the Eyrie is impregnable. You saw for yourself. No
enemy could ever reach us up here.”
Catelyn wanted to slap her. Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her, she realized. “No castle
is impregnable.”
“This one is,” Lysa insisted. “Everyone says so. The only thing is, what am I to do with
this Imp you have brought me?”
“Is he a bad man?” the Lord of the Eyrie asked, his mother’s breast popping from his
mouth, the nipple wet and red.
“A very bad man,” Lysa told him as she covered herself, “but Mother won’t let him harm
my little baby.”
“Make him fly,” Robert said eagerly.
Lysa stroked her son’s hair. “Perhaps we will,” she murmured. “Perhaps that is just what
we will do.”

EDDARD
He found Littlefinger in the brothel’s common room, chatting amiably with a tall,
elegant woman who wore a feathered gown over skin as black as ink. By the hearth,
Heward and a buxom wench were playing at forfeits. From the look of it, he’d lost his
belt, his cloak, his mail shirt, and his right boot so far, while the girl had been forced to
unbutton her shift to the waist. Jory Cassel stood beside a rain-streaked window with a
wry smile on his face, watching Heward turn over tiles and enjoying the view.
Ned paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on his gloves. “It’s time we took our leave.
My business here is done.”
Heward lurched to his feet, hurriedly gathering up his things. “As you will, my lord,”
Jory said. “I’ll help Wyl bring round the horses.” He strode to the door.
Littlefinger took his time saying his farewells. He kissed the black woman’s hand,
whispered some joke that made her laugh aloud, and sauntered over to Ned. “Your
business,” he said lightly, “or Robert’s? They say the Hand dreams the king’s dreams,
speaks with the king’s voice, and rules with the king’s sword. Does that also mean you
fuck with the king’s—”
“Lord Baelish,” Ned interrupted, “you presume too much. I am not ungrateful for your
help. It might have taken us years to find this brothel without you. That does not mean I
intend to endure your mockery. And I am no longer the King’s Hand.”
“The direwolf must be a prickly beast,” said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of his mouth.
A warm rain was pelting down from a starless black sky as they walked to the stables.
Ned drew up the hood of his cloak. Jory brought out his horse. Young Wyl came right
behind him, leading Littlefinger’s mare with one hand while the other fumbled with his
belt and the lacings of his trousers. A barefoot whore leaned out of the stable door,
giggling at him.
“Will we be going back to the castle now, my lord?” Jory asked. Ned nodded and swung
into the saddle. Littlefinger mounted up beside him. Jory and the others followed.
“Chataya runs a choice establishment,” Littlefinger said as they rode. “I’ve half a mind to

buy it. Brothels are a much sounder investment than ships, I’ve found. Whores seldom
sink, and when they are boarded by pirates, why, the pirates pay good coin like everyone
else.” Lord Petyr chuckled at his own wit.
Ned let him prattle on. After a time, he quieted and they rode in silence. The streets of
King’s Landing were dark and deserted. The rain had driven everyone under their roofs.
It beat down on Ned’s head, warm as blood and relentless as old guilts. Fat drops of
water ran down his face.
“Robert will never keep to one bed,” Lyanna had told him at Winterfell, on the night long
ago when their father had promised her hand to the young Lord of Storm’s End. “I hear
he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale.” Ned had held the babe in his arms; he
could scarcely deny her, nor would he lie to his sister, but he had assured her that what
Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter, that he was a good man and true who
would love her with all his heart. Lyanna had only smiled. “Love is sweet, dearest Ned,
but it cannot change a man’s nature.”
The girl had been so young Ned had not dared to ask her age. No doubt she’d been a
virgin; the better brothels could always find a virgin, if the purse was fat enough. She
had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose, and when
she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe, he saw that her bosom was
freckled as well. “I named her Barra,” she said as the child nursed. “She looks so like
him, does she not, milord? She has his nose, and his hair . . . ”
“She does.” Eddard Stark had touched the baby’s fine, dark hair. It flowed through his
fingers like black silk. Robert’s firstborn had had the same fine hair, he seemed to recall.
“Tell him that when you see him, milord, as it . . . as it please you. Tell him how beautiful
she is.”
“I will,” Ned had promised her. That was his curse. Robert would swear undying love
and forget them before evenfall, but Ned Stark kept his vows. He thought of the
promises he’d made Lyanna as she lay dying, and the price he’d paid to keep them.
“And tell him I’ve not been with no one else. I swear it, milord, by the old gods and new.
Chataya said I could have half a year, for the baby, and for hoping he’d come back. So
you’ll tell him I’m waiting, won’t you? I don’t want no jewels or nothing, just him. He
was always good to me, truly.”
Good to you, Ned thought hollowly. “I will tell him, child, and I promise you, Barra shall
not go wanting.”

She had smiled then, a smile so tremulous and sweet that it cut the heart out of him.
Riding through the rainy night, Ned saw Jon Snow’s face in front of him, so like a
younger version of his own. If the gods frowned so on bastards, he thought dully, why
did they fill men with such lusts? “Lord Baelish, what do you know of Robert’s bastards?”
“Well, he has more than you, for a start.”
“How many?”
Littlefinger shrugged. Rivulets of moisture twisted down the back of his cloak. “Does it
matter? If you bed enough women, some will give you presents, and His Grace has never
been shy on that count. I know he’s acknowledged that boy at Storm’s End, the one he
fathered the night Lord Stannis wed. He could hardly do otherwise. The mother was a
Florent, niece to the Lady Selyse, one of her bedmaids. Renly says that Robert carried
the girl upstairs during the feast, and broke in the wedding bed while Stannis and his
bride were still dancing. Lord Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his
wife’s House, so when the boy was born, he shipped him off to Renly.” He gave Ned a
sideways glance. “I’ve also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving
wench at Casterly Rock, three years ago when he went west for Lord Tywin’s tourney.
Cersei had the babes killed, and sold the mother to a passing slaver. Too much an affront
to Lannister pride, that close to home.”
Ned Stark grimaced. Ugly tales like that were told of every great lord in the realm. He
could believe it of Cersei Lannister readily enough . . . but would the king stand by and
let it happen? The Robert he had known would not have, but the Robert he had known
had never been so practiced at shutting his eyes to things he did not wish to see. “Why
would Jon Arryn take a sudden interest in the king’s baseborn children?”
The short man gave a sodden shrug. “He was the King’s Hand. Doubtless Robert asked
him to see that they were provided for.”
Ned was soaked through to the bone, and his soul had grown cold. “It had to be more
than that, or why kill him?”
Littlefinger shook the rain from his hair and laughed. “Now I see. Lord Arryn learned
that His Grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives, and for that he had to
be silenced. Small wonder. Allow a man like that to live, and next he’s like to blurt out
that the sun rises in the east.”
There was no answer Ned Stark could give to that but a frown. For the first time in years,
he found himself remembering Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if Rhaegar had
frequented brothels; somehow he thought not.

The rain was falling harder now, stinging the eyes and drumming against the ground.
Rivers of black water were running down the hill when Jory called out, “My lord,” his
voice hoarse with alarm. And in an instant, the street was full of soldiers.
Ned glimpsed ringmail over leather, gauntlets and greaves, steel helms with golden lions
on the crests. Their cloaks clung to their backs, sodden with rain. He had no time to
count, but there were ten at least, a line of them, on foot, blocking the street, with
longswords and iron-tipped spears. “Behind!” he heard Wyl cry, and when he turned his
horse, there were more in back of them, cutting off their retreat. Jory’s sword came
singing from its scabbard. “Make way or die!”
“The wolves are howling,” their leader said. Ned could see rain running down his face.
“Such a small pack, though.”
Littlefinger walked his horse forward, step by careful step. “What is the meaning of this?
This is the Hand of the King.”
“He was the Hand of the King.” The mud muffled the hooves of the blood bay stallion.
The line parted before him. On a golden breastplate, the lion of Lannister roared its
defiance. “Now, if truth be told, I’m not sure what he is.”
“Lannister, this is madness,” Littlefinger said. “Let us pass. We are expected back at the
castle. What do you think you’re doing?”
“He knows what he’s doing,” Ned said calmly.
Jaime Lannister smiled. “Quite true. I’m looking for my brother. You remember my
brother, don’t you, Lord Stark? He was with us at Winterfell. Fair-haired, mismatched
eyes, sharp of tongue. A short man.”
“I remember him well,” Ned replied.
“It would seem he has met some trouble on the road. My lord father is quite vexed. You
would not perchance have any notion of who might have wished my brother ill, would
you?”
“Your brother has been taken at my command, to answer for his crimes,” Ned Stark said.
Littlefinger groaned in dismay. “My lords—”
Ser Jaime ripped his longsword from its sheath and urged his stallion forward. “Show

me your steel, Lord Eddard. I’ll butcher you like Aerys if I must, but I’d sooner you died
with a blade in your hand.” He gave Littlefinger a cool, contemptuous glance. “Lord
Baelish, I’d leave here in some haste if I did not care to get bloodstains on my costly
clothing.”
Littlefinger did not need to be urged. “I will bring the City Watch,” he promised Ned.
The Lannister line parted to let him through, and closed behind him. Littlefinger put his
heels to his mare and vanished around a corner.
Ned’s men had drawn their swords, but they were three against twenty. Eyes watched
from nearby windows and doors, but no one was about to intervene. His party was
mounted, the Lannisters on foot save for Jaime himself. A charge might win them free,
but it seemed to Eddard Stark that they had a surer, safer tactic. “Kill me,” he warned
the Kingslayer, “and Catelyn will most certainly slay Tyrion.”
Jaime Lannister poked at Ned’s chest with the gilded sword that had sipped the blood of
the last of the Dragonkings. “Would she? The noble Catelyn Tully of Riverrun murder a
hostage? I think . . . not.” He sighed. “But I am not willing to chance my brother’s life on
a woman’s honor.” Jaime slid the golden sword into its sheath. “So I suppose I’ll let you
run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened you. I wonder if he’ll care.” Jaime pushed
his wet hair back with his fingers and wheeled his horse around. When he was beyond
the line of swordsmen, he glanced back at his captain. “Tregar, see that no harm comes
to Lord Stark.”
“As you say, m’lord.”
“Still . . . we wouldn’t want him to leave here entirely unchastened, so”—through the
night and the rain, he glimpsed the white of Jaime’s smile—“kill his men.”
“No!” Ned Stark screamed, clawing for his sword. Jaime was already cantering off down
the street as he heard Wyl shout. Men closed from both sides. Ned rode one down,
cutting at phantoms in red cloaks who gave way before him. Jory Cassel put his heels
into his mount and charged. A steel-shod hoof caught a Lannister guardsman in the face
with a sickening crunch. A second man reeled away and for an instant Jory was free. Wyl
cursed as they pulled him off his dying horse, swords slashing in the rain. Ned galloped
to him, bringing his longsword down on Tregar’s helm. The jolt of impact made him grit
his teeth. Tregar stumbled to his knees, his lion crest sheared in half, blood running
down his face. Heward was hacking at the hands that had seized his bridle when a spear
caught him in the belly. Suddenly Jory was back among them, a red rain flying from his
sword. “No!” Ned shouted. “Jory, away!” Ned’s horse slipped under him and came
crashing down in the mud. There was a moment of blinding pain and the taste of blood
in his mouth.

He saw them cut the legs from Jory’s mount and drag him to the earth, swords rising
and failing as they closed in around him. When Ned’s horse lurched back to its feet, he
tried to rise, only to fall again, choking on his scream. He could see the splintered bone
poking through his calf. It was the last thing he saw for a time. The rain came down and
down and down.
When he opened his eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead. His horse
moved closer, caught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away. Ned began to drag
himself through the mud, gritting his teeth at the agony in his leg. It seemed to take
years. Faces watched from candlelit windows, and people began to emerge from alleys
and doors, but no one moved to help.
Littlefinger and the City Watch found him there in the street, cradling Jory Cassel’s body
in his arms.
Somewhere the gold cloaks found a litter, but the trip back to the castle was a blur of
agony, and Ned lost consciousness more than once. He remembered seeing the Red
Keep looming ahead of him in the first grey light of dawn. The rain had darkened the
pale pink stone of the massive walls to the color of blood.
Then Grand Maester Pycelle was looming over him, holding a cup, whispering, “Drink,
my lord. Here. The milk of the poppy, for your pain.” He remembered swallowing, and
Pycelle was telling someone to heat the wine to boiling and fetch him clean silk, and that
was the last he knew.

DAENERYS
The Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak was made of two gigantic bronze stallions, rearing, their
hooves meeting a hundred feet above the roadway to form a pointed arch.
Dany could not have said why the city needed a gate when it had no walls . . . and no
buildings that she could see. Yet there it stood, immense and beautiful, the great horses
framing the distant purple mountain beyond. The bronze stallions threw long shadows
across the waving grasses as Khal Drogo led the khalasar under their hooves and down
the godsway, his bloodriders beside him.
Dany followed on her silver, escorted by Ser Jorah Mormont and her brother Viserys,
mounted once more. After the day in the grass when she had left him to walk back to the
khalasar, the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal Rhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King.
Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart the next day, and Viserys had accepted. In
his stubborn ignorance, he had not even known he was being mocked; the carts were for
eunuchs, cripples, women giving birth, the very young and the very old. That won him
yet another name: Khal Rhaggat, the Cart King. Her brother had thought it was the
khal’s way of apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him. She had begged Ser Jorah
not to tell him the truth, lest he be shamed. The knight had replied that the king could
well do with a bit of shame . . . yet he had done as she bid. It had taken much pleading,
and all the pillow tricks Doreah had taught her, before Dany had been able to make
Drogo relent and allow Viserys to rejoin them at the head of the column.
“Where is the city?” she asked as they passed beneath the bronze arch. There were no
buildings to be seen, no people, only the grass and the road, lined with ancient
monuments from all the lands the Dothraki had sacked over the centuries.
“Ahead,” Ser Jorah answered. “Under the mountain.”
Beyond the horse gate, plundered gods and stolen heroes loomed to either side of them.
The forgotten deities of dead cities brandished their broken thunderbolts at the sky as
Dany rode her silver past their feet. Stone kings looked down on her from their thrones,
their faces chipped and stained, even their names lost in the mists of time. Lithe young
maidens danced on marble plinths, draped only in flowers, or poured air from shattered
jars. Monsters stood in the grass beside the road; black iron dragons with jewels for
eyes, roaring griffins, manticores with their barbed tails poised to strike, and other

beasts she could not name. Some of the statues were so lovely they took her breath away,
others so misshapen and terrible that Dany could scarcely bear to look at them. Those,
Ser Jorah said, had likely come from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.
“So many,” she said as her silver stepped slowly onward, “and from so many lands.”
Viserys was less impressed. “The trash of dead cities,” he sneered. He was careful to
speak in the Common Tongue, which few Dothraki could understand, yet even so Dany
found herself glancing back at the men of her khas, to make certain he had not been
overheard. He went on blithely. “All these savages know how to do is steal the things
better men have built . . . and kill.” He laughed. “They do know how to kill. Otherwise I’d
have no use for them at all.”
“They are my people now,” Dany said. “You should not call them savages, brother.”
“The dragon speaks as he likes,” Viserys said . . . in the Common Tongue. He glanced
over his shoulder at Aggo and Rakharo, riding behind them, and favored them with a
mocking smile. “See, the savages lack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men.”
A moss-eaten stone monolith loomed over the road, fifty feet tall. Viserys gazed at it with
boredom in his eyes. “How long must we linger amidst these ruins before Drogo gives
me my army? I grow tired of waiting.”
“The princess must be presented to the dosh khaleen . . . ”
“The crones, yes,” her brother interrupted, “and there’s to be some mummer’s show of a
prophecy for the whelp in her belly, you told me. What is that to me? I’m tired of eating
horsemeat and I’m sick of the stink of these savages.” He sniffed at the wide, floppy
sleeve of his tunic, where it was his custom to keep a sachet. It could not have helped
much. The tunic was filthy. All the silk and heavy wools that Viserys had worn out of
Pentos were stained by hard travel and rotted from sweat.
Ser Jorah Mormont said, “The Western Market will have food more to your taste, Your
Grace. The traders from the Free Cities come there to sell their wares. The khal will
honor his promise in his own time.”
“He had better,” Viserys said grimly. “I was promised a crown, and I mean to have it.
The dragon is not mocked.” Spying an obscene likeness of a woman with six breasts and
a ferret’s head, he rode off to inspect it more closely.
Dany was relieved, yet no less anxious. “I pray that my sun-and-stars will not keep him
waiting too long,” she told Ser Jorah when her brother was out of earshot.

The knight looked after Viserys doubtfully. “Your brother should have bided his time in
Pentos. There is no place for him in a khalasar. Illyrio tried to warn him.”
“He will go as soon as he has his ten thousand. My lord husband promised a golden
crown.”
Ser Jorah grunted. “Yes, Khaleesi, but . . . the Dothraki look on these things differently
than we do in the west. I have told him as much, as Illyrio told him, but your brother
does not listen. The horselords are no traders. Viserys thinks he sold you, and now he
wants his price. Yet Khal Drogo would say he had you as a gift. He will give Viserys a gift
in return, yes . . . in his own time. You do not demand a gift, not of a khal. You do not
demand anything of a khal.”
“It is not right to make him wait.” Dany did not know why she was defending her
brother, yet she was. “Viserys says he could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten
thousand Dothraki screamers.”
Ser Jorah snorted. “Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms.”
Dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in his tone. “What . . . what if it were
not Viserys?” she asked. “If it were someone else who led them? Someone stronger?
Could the Dothraki truly conquer the Seven Kingdoms?”
Ser Jorah’s face grew thoughtful as their horses trod together down the godsway. “When
I first went into exile, I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked barbarians, as wild as
their horses. If you had asked me then, Princess, I should have told you that a thousand
good knights would have no trouble putting to flight a hundred times as many Dothraki.”
“But if I asked you now?”
“Now,” the knight said, “I am less certain. They are better riders than any knight, utterly
fearless, and their bows outrange ours. In the Seven Kingdoms, most archers fight on
foot, from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes. The Dothraki fire from
horseback, charging or retreating, it makes no matter, they are full as deadly . . . and
there are so many of them, my lady. Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand
mounted warriors in his khalasar.”
“Is that truly so many?”
“Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident,” Ser Jorah admitted, “but
of that number, no more than a tenth were knights. The rest were archers, freeriders,
and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes. When Rhaegar fell, many threw down

their weapons and fled the field. How long do you imagine such a rabble would stand
against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood? How well would
boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain?”
“Not long,” she said, “not well.”
He nodded. “Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the
gods gave a goose, it will never come to that. The riders have no taste for siegecraft. I
doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, but if Robert
Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle . . . ”
“Is he?” Dany asked. “A fool, I mean?”
Ser Jorah considered that for a moment. “Robert should have been born Dothraki,” he
said at last. “Your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls
instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand. The Usurper would agree. He is a
strong man, brave . . . and rash enough to meet a Dothraki horde in the open field. But
the men around him, well, their pipers play a different tune. His brother Stannis, Lord
Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark . . . ” He spat.
“You hate this Lord Stark,” Dany said.
“He took from me all I loved, for the sake of a few lice-ridden poachers and his precious
honor,” Ser Jorah said bitterly. From his tone, she could tell the loss still pained him. He
changed the subject quickly. “There,” he announced, pointing. “Vaes Dothrak. The city of
the horselords.”
Khal Drogo and his bloodriders led them through the great bazaar of the Western
Market, down the broad ways beyond. Dany followed close on her silver, staring at the
strangeness about her. Vaes Dothrak was at once the largest city and the smallest that
she had ever known. She thought it must be ten times as large as Pentos, a vastness
without walls or limits, its broad windswept streets paved in grass and mud and
carpeted with wildflowers. In the Free Cities of the west, towers and manses and hovels
and bridges and shops and halls all crowded in on one another, but Vaes Dothrak
sprawled languorously, baking in the warm sun, ancient, arrogant, and empty.
Even the buildings were so queer to her eyes. She saw carved stone pavilions, manses of
woven grass as large as castles, rickety wooden towers, stepped pyramids faced with
marble, log halls open to the sky. In place of walls, some palaces were surrounded by
thorny hedges. “None of them are alike,” she said.
“Your brother had part of the truth,” Ser Jorah admitted. “The Dothraki do not build. A

thousand years ago, to make a house, they would dig a hole in the earth and cover it with
a woven grass roof. The buildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands
they’ve plundered, and they built each after the fashion of their own peoples.”
Most of the halls, even the largest, seemed deserted. “Where are the people who live
here?” Dany asked. The bazaar had been full of running children and men shouting, but
elsewhere she had seen only a few eunuchs going about their business.
“Only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city, them and
their slaves and servants,” Ser Jorah replied, “yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house
every man of every khalasar, should all the khals return to the Mother at once. The
crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass, and so Vaes Dothrak must
be ready to embrace all its children.”
Khal Drogo finally called a halt near the Eastern Market where the caravans from Yi Ti
and Asshai and the Shadow Lands came to trade, with the Mother of Mountains looming
overhead. Dany smiled as she recalled Magister Illyrio’s slave girl and her talk of a palace
with two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver. The “palace” was a cavernous wooden
feasting hall, its rough-hewn timbered walls rising forty feet, its roof sewn silk, a vast
billowing tent that could be raised to keep out the rare rains, or lowered to admit the
endless sky. Around the hall were broad grassy horse yards fenced with high hedges,
firepits, and hundreds of round earthen houses that bulged from the ground like
miniature hills, covered with grass.
A small army of slaves had gone ahead to prepare for Khal Drogo’s arrival. As each rider
swung down from his saddle, he unbelted his arakh and handed it to a waiting slave,
and any other weapons he carried as well. Even Khal Drogo himself was not exempt. Ser
Jorah had explained that it was forbidden to carry a blade in Vaes Dothrak, or to shed a
free man’s blood. Even warring khalasars put aside their feuds and shared meat and
mead together when they were in sight of the Mother of Mountains. In this place, the
crones of the dosh khaleen had decreed, all Dothraki were one blood, one khalasar, one
herd.
Cohollo came to Dany as Irri and Jhiqui were helping her down off her silver. He was the
oldest of Drogo’s three bloodriders, a squat bald man with a crooked nose and a mouth
full of broken teeth, shattered by a mace twenty years before when he saved the young
khalakka from sellswords who hoped to sell him to his father’s enemies. His life had
been bound to Drogo’s the day her lord husband was born.
Every khal had his bloodriders. At first Dany had thought of them as a kind of Dothraki
Kingsguard, sworn to protect their lord, but it went further than that. Jhiqui had taught
her that a bloodrider was more than a guard; they were the khal’s brothers, his shadows,

his fiercest friends. “Blood of my blood,” Drogo called them, and so it was; they shared a
single life. The ancient traditions of the horselords demanded that when the khal died,
his bloodriders died with him, to ride at his side in the night lands. If the khal died at the
hands of some enemy, they lived only long enough to avenge him, and then followed him
joyfully into the grave. In some khalasars, Jhiqui said, the bloodriders shared the khal’s
wine, his tent, and even his wives, though never his horses. A man’s mount was his own.
Daenerys was glad that Khal Drogo did not hold to those ancient ways. She should not
have liked being shared. And while old Cohollo treated her kindly enough, the others
frightened her; Haggo, huge and silent, often glowered as if he had forgotten who she
was, and Qotho had cruel eyes and quick hands that liked to hurt. He left bruises on
Doreah’s soft white skin whenever he touched her, and sometimes made Irri sob in the
night. Even his horses seemed to fear him.
Yet they were bound to Drogo for life and death, so Daenerys had no choice but to accept
them. And sometimes she found herself wishing her father had been protected by such
men. In the songs, the white knights of the Kingsguard were ever noble, valiant, and
true, and yet King Aerys had been murdered by one of them, the handsome boy they
now called the Kingslayer, and a second, Ser Barristan the Bold, had gone over to the
Usurper. She wondered if all men were as false in the Seven Kingdoms. When her son
sat the Iron Throne, she would see that he had bloodriders of his own to protect him
against treachery in his Kingsguard.
“Khaleesi,” Cohollo said to her, in Dothraki. “Drogo, who is blood of my blood,
commands me to tell you that he must ascend the Mother of Mountains this night, to
sacrifice to the gods for his safe return.”
Only men were allowed to set foot on the Mother, Dany knew. The khal’s bloodriders
would go with him, and return at dawn. “Tell my sun-and-stars that I dream of him, and
wait anxious for his return,” she replied, thankful. Dany tired more easily as the child
grew within her; in truth, a night of rest would be most welcome. Her pregnancy only
seemed to have inflamed Drogo’s desire for her, and of late his embraces left her
exhausted.
Doreah led her to the hollow hill that had been prepared for her and her khal. It was cool
and dim within, like a tent made of earth. “Jhiqui, a bath, please,” she commanded, to
wash the dust of travel from her skin and soak her weary bones. It was pleasant to know
that they would linger here for a while, that she would not need to climb back on her
silver on the morrow.
The water was scalding hot, as she liked it. “I will give my brother his gifts tonight,” she
decided as Jhiqui was washing her hair. “He should look a king in the sacred city.

Doreah, run and find him and invite him to sup with me.” Viserys was nicer to the
Lysene girl than to her Dothraki handmaids, perhaps because Magister Illyrio had let
him bed her back in Pentos. “Irri, go to the bazaar and buy fruit and meat. Anything but
horseflesh.”
“Horse is best,” Irri said. “Horse makes a man strong.”
“Viserys hates horsemeat.”
“As you say, Khaleesi.”
She brought back a haunch of goat and a basket of fruits and vegetables. Jhiqui roasted
the meat with sweetgrass and firepods, basting it with honey as it cooked, and there were
melons and pomegranates and plums and some queer eastern fruit Dany did not know.
While her handmaids prepared the meal, Dany laid out the clothing she’d had made to
her brother’s measure: a tunic and leggings of crisp white linen, leather sandals that
laced up to the knee, a bronze medallion belt, a leather vest painted with fire-breathing
dragons. The Dothraki would respect him more if he looked less a beggar, she hoped,
and perhaps he would forgive her for shaming him that day in the grass. He was still her
king, after all, and her brother. They were both blood of the dragon.
She was arranging the last of his gifts—a sandsilk cloak, green as grass, with a pale grey
border that would bring out the silver in his hair—when Viserys arrived, dragging
Doreah by the arm. Her eye was red where he’d hit her. “How dare you send this whore
to give me commands,” he said. He shoved the handmaid roughly to the carpet.
The anger took Dany utterly by surprise. “I only wanted . . . Doreah, what did you say?”
“Khaleesi, pardons, forgive me. I went to him, as you bid, and told him you commanded
him to join you for supper.”
“No one commands the dragon,” Viserys snarled. “I am your king! I should have sent
you back her head!”
The Lysene girl quailed, but Dany calmed her with a touch. “Don’t be afraid, he won’t
hurt you. Sweet brother, please, forgive her, the girl misspoke herself, I told her to ask
you to sup with me, if it pleases Your Grace.” She took him by the hand and drew him
across the room. “Look. These are for you.”
Viserys frowned suspiciously. “What is all this?”
“New raiment. I had it made for you.” Dany smiled shyly.

He looked at her and sneered. “Dothraki rags. Do you presume to dress me now?”
“Please . . . you’ll be cooler and more comfortable, and I thought . . . maybe if you
dressed like them, the Dothraki . . . ” Dany did not know how to say it without waking his
dragon.
“Next you’ll want to braid my hair.”
“I’d never . . . ” Why was he always so cruel? She had only wanted to help. “You have no
right to a braid, you have won no victories yet.”
It was the wrong thing to say. Fury shone from his lilac eyes, yet he dared not strike her,
not with her handmaids watching and the warriors of her khas outside. Viserys picked
up the cloak and sniffed at it. “This stinks of manure. Perhaps I shall use it as a horse
blanket.”
“I had Doreah sew it specially for you,” she told him, wounded. “These are garments fit
for a khal.”
“I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, not some grass-stained savage with bells in his
hair,” Viserys spat back at her. He grabbed her arm. “You forget yourself, slut. Do you
think that big belly will protect you if you wake the dragon?”
His fingers dug into her arm painfully and for an instant Dany felt like a child again,
quailing in the face of his rage. She reached out with her other hand and grabbed the
first thing she touched, the belt she’d hoped to give him, a heavy chain of ornate bronze
medallions. She swung it with all her strength.
It caught him full in the face. Viserys let go of her. Blood ran down his cheek where the
edge of one of the medallions had sliced it open. “You are the one who forgets himself,”
Dany said to him. “Didn’t you learn anything that day in the grass? Leave me now,
before I summon my khas to drag you out. And pray that Khal Drogo does not hear of
this, or he will cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails.”
Viserys scrambled back to his feet. “When I come into my kingdom, you will rue this day,
slut.” He walked off, holding his torn face, leaving her gifts behind him.
Drops of his blood had spattered the beautiful sandsilk cloak. Dany clutched the soft
cloth to her cheek and sat cross-legged on her sleeping mats.
“Your supper is ready, Khaleesi,” Jhiqui announced.

“I’m not hungry,” Dany said sadly. She was suddenly very tired. “Share the food among
yourselves, and send some to Ser Jorah, if you would.” After a moment she added,
“Please, bring me one of the dragon’s eggs.”
Irri fetched the egg with the deep green shell, bronze flecks shining amid its scales as she
turned it in her small hands. Dany curled up on her side, pulling the sandsilk cloak
across her and cradling the egg in the hollow between her swollen belly and small,
tender breasts. She liked to hold them. They were so beautiful, and sometimes just being
close to them made her feel stronger, braver, as if somehow she were drawing strength
from the stone dragons locked inside.
She was lying there, holding the egg, when she felt the child move within her . . . as if he
were reaching out, brother to brother, blood to blood. “You are the dragon,” Dany
whispered to him, “the true dragon. I know it. I know it.” And she smiled, and went to
sleep dreaming of home.

BRAN
A light snow was falling. Bran could feel the flakes on his face, melting as they touched
his skin like the gentlest of rains. He sat straight atop his horse, watching as the iron
portcullis was winched upward. Try as he might to keep calm, his heart was fluttering in
his chest.
“Are you ready?” Robb asked.
Bran nodded, trying not to let his fear show. He had not been outside Winterfell since
his fall, but he was determined to ride out as proud as any knight.
“Let’s ride, then.” Robb put his heels into his big grey-and-white gelding, and the horse
walked under the portcullis.
“Go,” Bran whispered to his own horse. He touched her neck lightly, and the small
chestnut filly started forward. Bran had named her Dancer. She was two years old, and
Joseth said she was smarter than any horse had a right to be. They had trained her
special, to respond to rein and voice and touch. Up to now, Bran had only ridden her
around the yard. At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her, while Bran sat strapped to her
back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for him, but for the past fortnight he
had been riding her on his own, trotting her round and round, and growing bolder with
every circuit.
They passed beneath the gatehouse, over the drawbridge, through the outer walls.
Summer and Grey Wind came loping beside them, sniffing at the wind. Close behind
came Theon Greyjoy, with his longbow and a quiver of broadheads; he had a mind to
take a deer, he had told them. He was followed by four guardsmen in mailed shirts and
coifs, and Joseth, a stick-thin stableman whom Robb had named master of horse while
Hullen was away. Maester Luwin brought up the rear, riding on a donkey. Bran would
have liked it better if he and Robb had gone off alone, just the two of them, but Hal
Mollen would not hear of it, and Maester Luwin backed him. If Bran fell off his horse or
injured himself, the maester was determined to be with him.
Beyond the castle lay the market square, its wooden stalls deserted now. They rode down
the muddy streets of the village, past rows of small neat houses of log and undressed
stone. Less than one in five were occupied, thin tendrils of woodsmoke curling up from

their chimneys. The rest would fill up one by one as it grew colder. When the snow fell
and the ice winds howled down out of the north, Old Nan said, farmers left their frozen
fields and distant holdfasts, loaded up their wagons, and then the winter town came
alive. Bran had never seen it happen, but Maester Luwin said the day was looming
closer. The end of the long summer was near at hand. Winter is coming.
A few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past, and one man
dropped the wood he was carrying as he shrank away in fear, but most of the townfolk
had grown used to the sight. They bent the knee when they saw the boys, and Robb
greeted each of them with a lordly nod.
With his legs unable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse made Bran feel unsteady at
first, but the huge saddle with its thick horn and high back cradled him comfortingly,
and the straps around his chest and thighs would not allow him to fall. After a time the
rhythm began to feel almost natural. His anxiety faded, and a tremulous smile crept
across his face.
Two serving wenches stood beneath the sign of the Smoking Log, the local alehouse.
When Theon Greyjoy called out to them, the younger girl turned red and covered her
face. Theon spurred his mount to move up beside Robb. “Sweet Kyra,” he said with a
laugh. “She squirms like a weasel in bed, but say a word to her on the street, and she
blushes pink as a maid. Did I ever tell you about the night that she and Bessa—”
“Not where my brother can hear, Theon,” Robb warned him with a glance at Bran.
Bran looked away and pretended not to have heard, but he could feel Greyjoy’s eyes on
him. No doubt he was smiling. He smiled a lot, as if the world were a secret joke that
only he was clever enough to understand. Robb seemed to admire Theon and enjoy his
company, but Bran had never warmed to his father’s ward.
Robb rode closer. “You are doing well, Bran.”
“I want to go faster,” Bran replied.
Robb smiled. “As you will.” He sent his gelding into a trot. The wolves raced after him.
Bran snapped the reins sharply, and Dancer picked up her pace. He heard a shout from
Theon Greyjoy, and the hoofbeats of the other horses behind him.
Bran’s cloak billowed out, rippling in the wind, and the snow seemed to rush at his face.
Robb was well ahead, glancing back over his shoulder from time to time to make sure
Bran and the others were following. He snapped the reins again. Smooth as silk, Dancer
slid into a gallop. The distance closed. By the time he caught Robb on the edge of the

wolfswood, two miles beyond the winter town, they had left the others well behind. “I
can ride!” Bran shouted, grinning. It felt almost as good as flying.
“I’d race you, but I fear you’d win.” Robb’s tone was light and joking, yet Bran could tell
that something was troubling his brother underneath the smile.
“I don’t want to race.” Bran looked around for the direwolves. Both had vanished into
the wood. “Did you hear Summer howling last night?”
“Grey Wind was restless too,” Robb said. His auburn hair had grown shaggy and
unkempt, and a reddish stubble covered his jaw, making him look older than his fifteen
years. “Sometimes I think they know things . . . sense things . . . ” Robb sighed. “I never
know how much to tell you, Bran. I wish you were older.”
“I’m eight now!” Bran said. “Eight isn’t so much younger than fifteen, and I’m the heir to
Winterfell, after you.”
“So you are.” Robb sounded sad, and even a little scared. “Bran, I need to tell you
something. There was a bird last night. From King’s Landing. Maester Luwin woke me.”
Bran felt a sudden dread. Dark wings, dark words, Old Nan always said, and of late the
messenger ravens had been proving the truth of the proverb. When Robb wrote to the
Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, the bird that came back brought word that Uncle
Benjen was still missing. Then a message had arrived from the Eyrie, from Mother, but
that had not been good news either. She did not say when she meant to return, only that
she had taken the Imp as prisoner. Bran had sort of liked the little man, yet the name
Lannister sent cold fingers creeping up his spine. There was something about the
Lannisters, something he ought to remember, but when he tried to think what, he felt
dizzy and his stomach clenched hard as a stone. Robb spent most of that day locked
behind closed doors with Maester Luwin, Theon Greyjoy, and Hallis Mollen. Afterward,
riders were sent out on fast horses, carrying Robb’s commands throughout the north.
Bran heard talk of Moat Cailin, the ancient stronghold the First Men had built at the top
of the Neck. No one ever told him what was happening, yet he knew it was not good.
And now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. “Was the bird from
Mother? Is she coming home?”
“The message was from Alyn in King’s Landing. Jory Cassel is dead. And Wyl and
Heward as well. Murdered by the Kingslayer.” Robb lifted his face to the snow, and the
flakes melted on his cheeks. “May the gods give them rest.”
Bran did not know what to say. He felt as if he’d been punched. Jory had been captain of

the household guard at Winterfell since before Bran was born. “They killed Jory?” He
remembered all the times Jory had chased him over the roofs. He could picture him
striding across the yard in mail and plate, or sitting at his accustomed place on the
bench in the Great Hall, joking as he ate. “Why would anyone kill Jory?”
Robb shook his head numbly, the pain plain in his eyes. “I don’t know, and . . . Bran,
that’s not the worst of it. Father was caught beneath a falling horse in the fight. Alyn says
his leg was shattered, and . . . Maester Pycelle has given him the milk of the poppy, but
they aren’t sure when . . . when he . . .” The sound of hoofbeats made him glance down
the road, to where Theon and the others were coming up. “When he will wake,” Robb
finished. He laid his hand on the pommel of his sword then, and went on in the solemn
voice of Robb the Lord. “Bran, I promise you, whatever might happen, I will not let this
be forgotten.”
Something in his tone made Bran even more fearful. “What will you do?” he asked as
Theon Greyjoy reined in beside them.
“Theon thinks I should call the banners,” Robb said.
“Blood for blood.” For once Greyjoy did not smile. His lean, dark face had a hungry look
to it, and black hair fell down across his eyes.
“Only the lord can call the banners,” Bran said as the snow drifted down around them.
“If your father dies,” Theon said, “Robb will be Lord of Winterfell.”
“He won’t die!” Bran screamed at him.
Robb took his hand. “He won’t die, not Father,” he said calmly. “Still . . . the honor of the
north is in my hands now. When our lord father took his leave of us, he told me to be
strong for you and for Rickon. I’m almost a man grown, Bran.”
Bran shivered. “I wish Mother was back,” he said miserably. He looked around for
Maester Luwin; his donkey was visible in the far distance, trotting over a rise. “Does
Maester Luwin say to call the banners too?”
“The maester is timid as an old woman,” said Theon.
“Father always listened to his counsel,” Bran reminded his brother. “Mother too.”
“I listen to him,” Robb insisted. “I listen to everyone.”

The joy Bran had felt at the ride was gone, melted away like the snowflakes on his face.
Not so long ago, the thought of Robb calling the banners and riding off to war would
have filled him with excitement, but now he felt only dread. “Can we go back now?” he
asked. “I’m cold.”
Robb glanced around. “We need to find the wolves. Can you stand to go a bit longer?”
“I can go as long as you can.” Maester Luwin had warned him to keep the ride short, for
fear of saddle sores, but Bran would not admit to weakness in front of his brother. He
was sick of the way everyone was always fussing over him and asking how he was.
“Let’s hunt down the hunters, then,” Robb said. Side by side, they urged their mounts off
the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood. Theon dropped back and followed well
behind them, talking and joking with the guardsmen.
It was nice under the trees. Bran kept Dancer to a walk, holding the reins lightly and
looking all around him as they went. He knew this wood, but he had been so long
confined to Winterfell that he felt as though he were seeing it for the first time. The
smells filled his nostrils; the sharp fresh tang of pine needles, the earthy odor of wet
rotting leaves, the hints of animal musk and distant cooking fires. He caught a glimpse
of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered branches of an oak, and paused to
study the silvery web of an empress spider.
Theon and the others fell farther and farther behind, until Bran could no longer hear
their voices. From ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters. It grew louder until
they reached the stream. Tears stung his eyes.
“Bran?” Robb asked. “What’s wrong?”
Bran shook his head. “I was just remembering,” he said. “Jory brought us here once, to
fish for trout. You and me and Jon. Do you remember?”
“I remember,” Robb said, his voice quiet and sad.
“I didn’t catch anything,” Bran said, “but Jon gave me his fish on the way back to
Winterfell. Will we ever see Jon again?”
“We saw Uncle Benjen when the king came to visit,” Robb pointed out. “Jon will visit
too, you’ll see.”
The stream was running high and fast. Robb dismounted and led his gelding across the

ford. In the deepest part of the crossing, the water came up to midthigh. He tied his
horse to a tree on the far side, and waded back across for Bran and Dancer. The current
foamed around rock and root, and Bran could feel the spray on his face as Robb led him
over. It made him smile. For a moment he felt strong again, and whole. He looked up at
the trees and dreamed of climbing them, right up to the very top, with the whole forest
spread out beneath him.
They were on the far side when they heard the howl, a long rising wail that moved
through the trees like a cold wind. Bran raised his head to listen. “Summer,” he said. No
sooner had he spoken than a second voice joined the first.
“They’ve made a kill,” Robb said as he remounted. “I’d best go and bring them back.
Wait here, Theon and the others should be along shortly.”
“I want to go with you,” Bran said.
“I’ll find them faster by myself.” Robb spurred his gelding and vanished into the trees.
Once he was gone, the woods seemed to close in around Bran. The snow was falling
more heavily now. Where it touched the ground it melted, but all about him rock and
root and branch wore a thin blanket of white. As he waited, he was conscious of how
uncomfortable he felt. He could not feel his legs, hanging useless in the stirrups, but the
strap around his chest was tight and chafing, and the melting snow had soaked through
his gloves to chill his hands. He wondered what was keeping Theon and Maester Luwin
and Joseth and the rest.
When he heard the rustle of leaves, Bran used the reins to make Dancer turn, expecting
to see his friends, but the ragged men who stepped out onto the bank of the stream were
strangers.
“Good day to you,” he said nervously. One look, and Bran knew they were neither
foresters nor farmers. He was suddenly conscious of how richly he was dressed. His
surcoat was new, dark grey wool with silver buttons, and a heavy silver pin fastened his
fur-trimmed cloak at the shoulders. His boots and gloves were lined with fur as well.
“All alone, are you?” said the biggest of them, a bald man with a raw windburnt face.
“Lost in the wolfswood, poor lad.”
“I’m not lost.” Bran did not like the way the strangers were looking at him. He counted
four, but when he turned his head, he saw two others behind him. “My brother rode off
just a moment ago, and my guard will be here shortly.”

“Your guard, is it?” a second man said. Grey stubble covered his gaunt face. “And what
would they be guarding, my little lord? Is that a silver pin I see there on your cloak?”
“Pretty,” said a woman’s voice. She scarcely looked like a woman; tall and lean, with the
same hard face as the others, her hair hidden beneath a bowl-shaped halfhelm. The
spear she held was eight feet of black oak, tipped in rusted steel.
“Let’s have a look,” said the big bald man.
Bran watched him anxiously. The man’s clothes were filthy, fallen almost to pieces,
patched here with brown and here with blue and there with a dark green, and faded
everywhere to grey, but once that cloak might have been black. The grey stubbly man
wore black rags too, he saw with a sudden start. Suddenly Bran remembered the
oathbreaker his father had beheaded, the day they had found the wolf pups; that man
had worn black as well, and Father said he had been a deserter from the Night’s Watch.
No man is more dangerous, he remembered Lord Eddard saying. The deserter knows
his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile
or cruel.
“The pin, lad,” the big man said. He held out his hand.
“We’ll take the horse too,” said another of them, a woman shorter than Robb, with a
broad fiat face and lank yellow hair. “Get down, and be quick about it.” A knife slid from
her sleeve into her hand, its edge jagged as a saw.
“No,” Bran blurted. “I can’t . . . ”
The big man grabbed his reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer around and
gallop off. “You can, lordling . . . and will, if you know what’s good for you.”
“Stiv, look how he’s strapped on.” The tall woman pointed with her spear. “Might be it’s
the truth he’s telling.”
“Straps, is it?” Stiv said. He drew a dagger from a sheath at his belt. “There’s ways to deal
with straps.”
“You some kind of cripple?” asked the short woman.
Bran flared. “I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell, and you better let go of my horse, or I’ll
see you all dead.”
The gaunt man with the grey stubbled face laughed. “The boy’s a Stark, true enough.

Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg.”
“Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth,” suggested the short woman. “That
should shut him up.”
“You’re as stupid as you are ugly, Hali,” said the tall woman. “The boy’s worth nothing
dead, but alive . . . gods be damned, think what Mance would give to have Benjen Stark’s
own blood to hostage!”
“Mance be damned,” the big man cursed. “You want to go back there, Osha? More fool
you. Think the white walkers will care if you have a hostage?” He turned back to Bran
and slashed at the strap around his thigh. The leather parted with a sigh.
The stroke had been quick and careless, biting deep. Looking down, Bran glimpsed pale
flesh where the wool of his leggings had parted. Then the blood began to flow. He
watched the red stain spread, feeling light-headed, curiously apart; there had been no
pain, not even a hint of feeling. The big man grunted in surprise.
“Put down your steel now, and I promise you shall have a quick and painless death,”
Robb called out.
Bran looked up in desperate hope, and there he was. The strength of the words were
undercut by the way his voice cracked with strain. He was mounted, the bloody carcass
of an elk slung across the back of his horse, his sword in a gloved hand.
“The brother,” said the man with the grey stubbly face.
“He’s a fierce one, he is,” mocked the short woman. Hali, they called her. “You mean to
fight us, boy?”
“Don’t be a fool, lad. You’re one against six.” The tall woman, Osha, leveled her spear.
“Off the horse, and throw down the sword. We’ll thank you kindly for the mount and for
the venison, and you and your brother can be on your way.”
Robb whistled. They heard the faint sound of soft feet on wet leaves. The undergrowth
parted, low-hanging branches giving up their accumulation of snow, and Grey Wind and
Summer emerged from the green. Summer sniffed the air and growled.
“Wolves,” gasped Hali.
“Direwolves,” Bran said. Still half-grown, they were as large as any wolf he had ever

seen, but the differences were easy to spot, if you knew what to look for. Maester Luwin
and Farlen the kennelmaster had taught him. A direwolf had a bigger head and longer
legs in proportion to its body, and its snout and jaw were markedly leaner and more
pronounced. There was something gaunt and terrible about them as they stood there
amid the gently falling snow. Fresh blood spotted Grey Wind’s muzzle.
“Dogs,” the big bald man said contemptuously. “Yet I’m told there’s nothing like a
wolfskin cloak to warm a man by night.” He made a sharp gesture. “Take them.”
Robb shouted, “Winterfell!” and kicked his horse. The gelding plunged down the bank as
the ragged men closed. A man with an axe rushed in, shouting and heedless. Robb’s
sword caught him full in the face with a sickening crunch and a spray of bright blood.
The man with the gaunt stubbly face made a grab for the reins, and for half a second he
had them . . . and then Grey Wind was on him, bearing him down. He fell back into the
stream with a splash and a shout, flailing wildly with his knife as his head went under.
The direwolf plunged in after him, and the white water turned red where they had
vanished.
Robb and Osha matched blows in midstream. Her long spear was a steel-headed
serpent, flashing out at his chest, once, twice, three times, but Robb parried every thrust
with his longsword, turning the point aside. On the fourth or fifth thrust, the tall woman
overextended herself and lost her balance, just for a second. Robb charged, riding her
down.
A few feet away, Summer darted in and snapped at Hali. The knife bit at his flank.
Summer slid away, snarling, and came rushing in again. This time his jaws closed
around her calf. Holding the knife with both hands, the small woman stabbed down, but
the direwolf seemed to sense the blade coming. He pulled free for an instant, his mouth
full of leather and cloth and bloody flesh. When Hali stumbled and fell, he came at her
again, slamming her backward, teeth tearing at her belly.
The sixth man ran from the carnage . . . but not far. As he went scrambling up the far
side of the bank, Grey Wind emerged from the stream, dripping wet. He shook the water
off and bounded after the running man, hamstringing him with a single snap of his
teeth, and going for the throat as the screaming man slid back down toward the water.
And then there was no one left but the big man, Stiv. He slashed at Bran’s chest strap,
grabbed his arm, and yanked. Suddenly Bran was falling. He sprawled on the ground,
his legs tangled under him, one foot in the stream. He could not feel the cold of the
water, but he felt the steel when Stiv pressed his dagger to his throat. “Back away,” the
man warned, “or I’ll open the boy’s windpipe, I swear it.”

Robb reined his horse in, breathing hard. The fury went out of his eyes, and his sword
arm dropped.
In that moment Bran saw everything. Summer was savaging Hali, pulling glistening blue
snakes from her belly. Her eyes were wide and staring. Bran could not tell whether she
was alive or dead. The grey stubbly man and the one with the axe lay unmoving, but
Osha was on her knees, crawling toward her fallen spear. Grey Wind padded toward her,
dripping wet. “Call him off!” the big man shouted. “Call them both off, or the cripple boy
dies now!”
“Grey Wind, Summer, to me,” Robb said.
The direwolves stopped, turned their heads. Grey Wind loped back to Robb. Summer
stayed where he was, his eyes on Bran and the man beside him. He growled. His muzzle
was wet and red, but his eyes burned.
Osha used the butt end of her spear to lever herself back to her feet. Blood leaked from a
wound on the upper arm where Robb had cut her. Bran could see sweat trickling down
the big man’s face. Stiv was as scared as he was, he realized. “Starks,” the man muttered,
“bloody Starks.” He raised his voice. “Osha, kill the wolves and get his sword.”
“Kill them yourself,” she replied. “I’ll not be getting near those monsters.”
For a moment Stiv was at a loss. His hand trembled; Bran felt a trickle of blood where
the knife pressed against his neck. The stench of the man filled his nose; he smelled of
fear. “You,” he called out to Robb. “You have a name?”
“I am Robb Stark, the heir to Winterfell.”
“This is your brother?”
“Yes.”
“You want him alive, you do what I say. Off the horse.”
Robb hesitated a moment. Then, slowly and deliberately, he dismounted and stood with
his sword in hand.
“Now kill the wolves.”
Robb did not move.

“You do it. The wolves or the boy.”
“No!” Bran screamed. If Robb did as they asked, Stiv would kill them both anyway, once
the direwolves were dead.
The bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly, till Bran
sobbed in pain. “You shut your mouth, cripple, you hear me?” He twisted harder. “You
hear me?”
A low thrum came from the woods behind them. Stiv gave a choked gasp as a half foot of
razor-tipped broadhead suddenly exploded out of his chest. The arrow was bright red, as
if it had been painted in blood.
The dagger fell away from Bran’s throat. The big man swayed and collapsed, facedown in
the stream. The arrow broke beneath him. Bran watched his life go swirling off in the
water.
Osha glanced around as Father’s guardsmen appeared from beneath the trees, steel in
hand. She threw down her spear. “Mercy, m’lord,” she called to Robb.
The guardsmen had a strange, pale look to their faces as they took in the scene of
slaughter. They eyed the wolves uncertainly, and when Summer returned to Hali’s
corpse to feed, Joseth dropped his knife and scrambled for the bush, heaving. Even
Maester Luwin seemed shocked as he stepped from behind a tree, but only for an
instant. Then he shook his head and waded across the stream to Bran’s side. “Are you
hurt?”
“He cut my leg,” Bran said, “but I couldn’t feel it.”
As the maester knelt to examine the wound, Bran turned his head. Theon Greyjoy stood
beside a sentinel tree, his bow in hand. He was smiling. Ever smiling. A half-dozen
arrows were thrust into the soft ground at his feet, but it had taken only one. “A dead
enemy is a thing of beauty,” he announced.
“Jon always said you were an ass, Greyjoy,” Robb said loudly. “I ought to chain you up in
the yard and let Bran take a few practice shots at you.”
“You should be thanking me for saving your brother’s life.”
“What if you had missed the shot?” Robb said. “What if you’d only wounded him? What
if you had made his hand jump, or hit Bran instead? For all you knew, the man might

have been wearing a breastplate, all you could see was the back of his cloak. What would
have happened to my brother then? Did you ever think of that, Greyjoy?”
Theon’s smile was gone. He gave a sullen shrug and began to pull his arrows from the
ground, one by one.
Robb glared at his guardsmen. “Where were you?” he demanded of them. “I was sure
you were close behind us.”
The men traded unhappy glances. “We were following, m’lord,” said Quent, the youngest
of them, his beard a soft brown fuzz. “Only first we waited for Maester Luwin and his
ass, begging your pardons, and then, well, as it were . . . ” He glanced over at Theon and
quickly looked away, abashed.
“I spied a turkey,” Theon said, annoyed by the question. “How was I to know that you’d
leave the boy alone?”
Robb turned his head to look at Theon once more. Bran had never seen him so angry, yet
he said nothing. Finally he knelt beside Maester Luwin. “How badly is my brother
wounded?”
“No more than a scratch,” the maester said. He wet a cloth in the stream to clean the cut.
“Two of them wear the black,” he told Robb as he worked.
Robb glanced over at where Stiv lay sprawled in the stream, his ragged black cloak
moving fitfully as the rushing waters tugged at it. “Deserters from the Night’s Watch,” he
said grimly. “They must have been fools, to come so close to Winterfell.”
“Folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart,” said Maester Luwin.
“Shall we bury them, m’lord?” asked Quent.
“They would not have buried us,” Robb said. “Hack off their heads, we’ll send them back
to the Wall. Leave the rest for the carrion crows.”
“And this one?” Quent jerked a thumb toward Osha.
Robb walked over to her. She was a head taller than he was, but she dropped to her
knees at his approach. “Give me my life, m’lord of Stark, and I am yours.”
“Mine? What would I do with an oathbreaker?”

“I broke no oaths. Stiv and Wallen flew down off the Wall, not me. The black crows got
no place for women.”
Theon Greyjoy sauntered closer. “Give her to the wolves,” he urged Robb. The woman’s
eyes went to what was left of Hali, and just as quickly away. She shuddered. Even the
guardsmen looked queasy.
“She’s a woman,” Robb said.
“A wildling,” Bran told him. “She said they should keep me alive so they could take me to
Mance Rayder.”
“Do you have a name?” Robb asked her.
“Osha, as it please the lord,” she muttered sourly.
Maester Luwin stood. “We might do well to question her.”
Bran could see the relief on his brother’s face. “As you say, Maester. Wayn, bind her
hands. She’ll come back to Winterfell with us . . . and live or die by the truths she gives
us.”

TYRION
You want eat?” Mord asked, glowering. He had a plate of oiled beans in one thick, stubfingered hand.
Tyrion Lannister was starved, but he refused to let this brute see him cringe. “A leg of
lamb would be pleasant,” he said, from the heap of soiled straw in the corner of his cell.
“Perhaps a dish of peas and onions, some fresh baked bread with butter, and a flagon of
mulled wine to wash it down. Or beer, if that’s easier. I try not to be overly particular.”
“Is beans,” Mord said. “Here.” He held out the plate.
Tyrion sighed. The turnkey was twenty stone of gross stupidity, with brown rotting teeth
and small dark eyes. The left side of his face was slick with scar where an axe had cut off
his ear and part of his cheek. He was as predictable as he was ugly, but Tyrion was
hungry. He reached up for the plate.
Mord jerked it away, grinning. “Is here,” he said, holding it out beyond Tyrion’s reach.
The dwarf climbed stiffly to his feet, every joint aching. “Must we play the same fool’s
game with every meal?” He made another grab for the beans.
Mord shambled backward, grinning through his rotten teeth. “Is here, dwarf man.” He
held the plate out at arm’s length, over the edge where the cell ended and the sky began.
“You not want eat? Here. Come take.”
Tyrion’s arms were too short to reach the plate, and he was not about to step that close
to the edge. All it would take would be a quick shove of Mord’s heavy white belly, and he
would end up a sickening red splotch on the stones of Sky, like so many other prisoners
of the Eyrie over the centuries. “Come to think on it, I’m not hungry after all,” he
declared, retreating to the corner of his cell.
Mord grunted and opened his thick fingers. The wind took the plate, flipping it over as it
fell. A handful of beans sprayed back at them as the food tumbled out of sight. The
turnkey laughed, his gut shaking like a bowl of pudding.
Tyrion felt a pang of rage. “You fucking son of a pox-ridden ass,” he spat. “I hope you die

of a bloody flux.”
For that, Mord gave him a kick, driving a steel-toed boot hard into Tyrion’s ribs on the
way out. “I take it back!” he gasped as he doubled over on the straw. “I’ll kill you myself,
I swear it!” The heavy iron-bound door slammed shut. Tyrion heard the rattle of keys.
For a small man, he had been cursed with a dangerously big mouth, he reflected as he
crawled back to his corner of what the Arryns laughably called their dungeon. He
huddled beneath the thin blanket that was his only bedding, staring out at a blaze of
empty blue sky and distant mountains that seemed to go on forever, wishing he still had
the shadowskin cloak he’d won from Marillion at dice, after the singer had stolen it off
the body of that brigand chief. The skin had smelled of blood and mold, but it was warm
and thick. Mord had taken it the moment he laid eyes on it.
The wind tugged at his blanket with gusts sharp as talons. His cell was miserably small,
even for a dwarf. Not five feet away, where a wall ought to have been, where a wall would
be in a proper dungeon, the floor ended and the sky began. He had plenty of fresh air
and sunshine, and the moon and stars by night, but Tyrion would have traded it all in an
instant for the dankest, gloomiest pit in the bowels of the Casterly Rock.
“You fly,” Mord had promised him, when he’d shoved him into the cell. “Twenty day,
thirty, fifty maybe. Then you fly.”
The Arryns kept the only dungeon in the realm where the prisoners were welcome to
escape at will. That first day, after girding up his courage for hours, Tyrion had lain flat
on his stomach and squirmed to the edge, to poke out his head and look down. Sky was
six hundred feet below, with nothing between but empty air. If he craned his neck out as
far as it could go, he could see other cells to his right and left and above him. He was a
bee in a stone honeycomb, and someone had torn off his wings.
It was cold in the cell, the wind screamed night and day, and worst of all, the floor
sloped. Ever so slightly, yet it was enough. He was afraid to close his eyes, afraid that he
might roll over in his steep and wake in sudden terror as he went sliding off the edge.
Small wonder the sky cells drove men mad.
Gods save me, some previous tenant had written on the wall in something that looked
suspiciously like blood, the blue is calling. At first Tyrion wondered who he’d been, and
what had become of him; later, he decided that he would rather not know.
If only he had shut his mouth . . .
The wretched boy had started it, looking down on him from a throne of carved weirwood

beneath the moon-and-falcon banners of House Arryn. Tyrion Lannister had been
looked down on all his life, but seldom by rheumy-eyed six-year-olds who needed to
stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift them to the height of a man. “Is he the bad
man?” the boy had asked, clutching his doll.
“He is,” the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him. She was all in blue,
powdered and perfumed for the suitors who filled her court.
“He’s so small,” the Lord of the Eyrie said, giggling.
“This is Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister, who murdered your father.” She raised her
voice so it carried down the length of High Hall of the Eyrie, ringing off the milk-white
walls and the slender pillars, so every man could hear it. “He slew the Hand of the King!”
“Oh, did I kill him too?” Tyrion had said, like a fool.
That would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his head
bowed. He could see that now; seven hells, he had seen it then. The High Hall of the
Arryns was long and austere, with a forbidding coldness to its walls of blue-veined white
marble, but the faces around him had been colder by far. The power of Casterly Rock
was far away, and there were no friends of the Lannisters in the Vale of Arryn.
Submission and silence would have been his best defenses.
But Tyrion’s mood had been too foul for sense. To his shame, he had faltered during the
last leg of their day-long climb up to the Eyrie, his stunted legs unable to take him any
higher. Bronn had carried him the rest of the way, and the humiliation poured oil on the
flames of his anger. “It would seem I’ve been a busy little fellow,” he said with bitter
sarcasm. “I wonder when I found the time to do all this slaying and murdering.”
He ought to have remembered who he was dealing with. Lysa Arryn and her half-sane
weakling son had not been known at court for their love of wit, especially when it was
directed at them.
“Imp,” Lysa said coldly, “you will guard that mocking tongue of yours and speak to my
son politely, or I promise you will have cause to regret it. Remember where you are. This
is the Eyrie, and these are knights of the Vale you see around you, true men who loved
Jon Arryn well. Every one of them would die for me.”
“Lady Arryn, should any harm come to me, my brother Jaime will be pleased to see that
they do.” Even as he spat out the words, Tyrion knew they were folly.
“Can you fly, my lord of Lannister?” Lady Lysa asked. “Does a dwarf have wings? If not,

you would be wiser to swallow the next threat that comes to mind.”
“I made no threats,” Tyrion said. “That was a promise.”
Little Lord Robert hopped to his feet at that, so upset he dropped his doll. “You can’t
hurt us,” he screamed. “No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mother, tell him he can’t hurt
us here.” The boy began to twitch.
“The Eyrie is impregnable,” Lysa Arryn declared calmly. She drew her son close, holding
him safe in the circle of her plump white arms. “The Imp is trying to frighten us, sweet
baby. The Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my sweet boy.”
The hell of it was, she was no doubt right. Having seen what it took to get here, Tyrion
could well imagine how it would be for a knight trying to fight his way up in armor, while
stones and arrows poured down from above and enemies contested with him for every
step. Nightmare did not begin to describe it. Small wonder the Eyrie had never been
taken.
Still, Tyrion had been unable to silence himself. “Not impregnable,” he said, “merely
inconvenient.”
Young Robert pointed down, his hand trembling. “You’re a liar. Mother, I want to see
him fly.” Two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks seized Tyrion by the arms, lifting him off his
floor.
The gods only know what might have happened then were it not for Catelyn Stark.
“Sister,” she called out from where she stood below the thrones, “I beg you to remember,
this man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.”
Lysa Arryn glanced at her sister coolly for a moment, then rose and swept down on
Tyrion, her long skirts trailing after her. For an instant he feared she would strike him,
but instead she commanded them to release him. Her men shoved him to the floor, his
legs went out from under him, and Tyrion fell.
He must have made quite a sight as he struggled to his knees, only to feel his right leg
spasm, sending him sprawling once more. Laughter boomed up and down the High Hall
of the Arryns.
“My sister’s little guest is too weary to stand,” Lady Lysa announced. “Ser Vardis, take
him down to the dungeon. A rest in one of our sky cells will do him much good.”
The guardsmen jerked him upright. Tyrion Lannister dangled between them, kicking

feebly, his face red with shame. “I will remember this,” he told them all as they carried
him off.
And so he did, for all the good it did him.
At first he had consoled himself that this imprisonment could not last long. Lysa Arryn
wanted to humble him, that was all. She would send for him again, and soon. If not her,
then Catelyn Stark would want to question him. This time he would guard his tongue
more closely. They dare not kill him out of hand; he was still a Lannister of Casterly
Rock, and if they shed his blood, it would mean war. Or so he had told himself.
Now he was not so certain.
Perhaps his captors only meant to let him rot here, but he feared he did not have the
strength to rot for long. He was growing weaker every day, and it was only a matter of
time until Mord’s kicks and blows did him serious harm, provided the gaoler did not
starve him to death first. A few more nights of cold and hunger, and the blue would start
calling to him too.
He wondered what was happening beyond the walls (such as they were) of his cell. Lord
Tywin would surely have sent out riders when the word reached him. Jaime might be
leading a host through the Mountains of the Moon even now . . . unless he was riding
north against Winterfell instead. Did anyone outside the Vale even suspect where
Catelyn Stark had taken him? He wondered what Cersei would do when she heard. The
king could order him freed, but would Robert listen to his queen or his Hand? Tyrion
had no illusions about the king’s love for his sister.
If Cersei kept her wits about her, she would insist the king sit in judgment of Tyrion
himself. Even Ned Stark could scarcely object to that, not without impugning the honor
of the king. And Tyrion would be only too glad to take his chances in a trial. Whatever
murders they might lay at his door, the Starks had no proof of anything so far as he
could see. Let them make their case before the Iron Throne and the lords of the land. It
would be the end of them. If only Cersei were clever enough to see that . . .
Tyrion Lannister sighed. His sister was not without a certain low cunning, but her pride
blinded her. She would see the insult in this, not the opportunity. And Jaime was even
worse, rash and headstrong and quick to anger. His brother never untied a knot when he
could slash it in two with his sword.
He wondered which of them had sent the footpad to silence the Stark boy, and whether
they had truly conspired at the death of Lord Arryn. If the old Hand had been murdered,
it was deftly and subtly done. Men of his age died of sudden illness all the time. In

contrast, sending some oaf with a stolen knife after Brandon Stark struck him as
unbelievably clumsy. And wasn’t that peculiar, come to think on it . . .
Tyrion shivered. Now there was a nasty suspicion. Perhaps the direwolf and the lion
were not the only beasts in the woods, and if that was true, someone was using him as a
catspaw. Tyrion Lannister hated being used.
He would have to get out of here, and soon. His chances of overpowering Mord were
small to none, and no one was about to smuggle him a six-hundred-foot-long rope, so he
would have to talk himself free. His mouth had gotten him into this cell; it could damn
well get him out.
Tyrion pushed himself to his feet, doing his best to ignore the slope of the floor beneath
him, with its ever-so-subtle tug toward the edge. He hammered on the door with a fist.
“Mord!” he shouted. “Turnkey! Mord, I want you!” He had to keep it up a good ten
minutes before he heard footsteps. Tyrion stepped back an instant before the door
opened with a crash.
“Making noise,” Mord growled, with blood in his eyes. Dangling from one meaty hand
was a leather strap, wide and thick, doubled over in his fist.
Never show them you’re afraid, Tyrion reminded himself. “How would you like to be
rich?” he asked.
Mord hit him. He swung the strap backhand, lazily, but the leather caught Tyrion high
on the arm. The force of it staggered him, and the pain made him grit his teeth. “No
mouth, dwarf man,” Mord warned him.
“Gold,” Tyrion said, miming a smile. “Casterly Rock is full of gold . . . ahhhh . . . ” This
time the blow was a forehand, and Mord put more of his arm into the swing, making the
leather crack and jump. It caught Tyrion in the ribs and dropped him to his knees,
wimpering. He forced himself to look up at the gaoler. “As rich as the Lannisters,” he
wheezed. “That’s what they say, Mord—”
Mord grunted. The strap whistled through the air and smashed Tyrion full in the face.
The pain was so bad he did not remember falling, but when he opened his eyes again he
was on the floor of his cell. His ear was ringing, and his mouth was full of blood. He
groped for purchase, to push himself up, and his fingers brushed against . . . nothing.
Tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had been scalded, and tried his best to stop
breathing. He had fallen right on the edge, inches from the blue.
“More to say?” Mord held the strap between his fists and gave it a sharp pull. The snap

made Tyrion jump. The turnkey laughed.
He won’t push me over, Tyrion told himself desperately as he crawled away from the
edge. Catelyn Stark wants me alive, he doesn’t dare kill me. He wiped the blood off his
lips with the back of his hand, grinned, and said, “That was a stiff one, Mord.” The gaoler
squinted at him, trying to decide if he was being mocked. “I could make good use of a
strong man like you.” The strap flew at him, but this time Tyrion was able to cringe away
from it. He took a glancing blow to the shoulder, nothing more. “Gold,” he repeated,
scrambling backward like a crab, “more gold than you’ll see here in a lifetime. Enough to
buy land, women, horses . . . you could be a lord. Lord Mord.” Tyrion hawked up a glob
of blood and phlegm and spat it out into the sky.
“Is no gold,” Mord said.
He’s listening! Tyrion thought. “They relieved me of my purse when they captured me,
but the gold is still mine. Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner, but she’d never stoop
to rob him. That wouldn’t be honorable. Help me, and all the gold is yours.” Mord’s strap
licked out, but it was a halfhearted, desultory swing, slow and contemptuous. Tyrion
caught the leather in his hand and held it prisoned. “There will be no risk to you. All you
need do is deliver a message.”
The gaoler yanked his leather strap free of Tyrion’s grasp. “Message,” he said, as if he
had never heard the word before. His frown made deep creases in his brow.
“You heard me, my lord. Only carry my word to your lady. Tell her . . . ” What? What
would possibly make Lysa Anyn relent? The inspiration came to Tyrion Lannister
suddenly. “ . . . .tell her that I wish to confess my crimes.”
Mord raised his arm and Tyrion braced himself for another blow, but the turnkey
hesitated. Suspicion and greed warred in his eyes. He wanted that gold, yet he feared a
trick; he had the look of a man who had often been tricked. “Is lie,” he muttered darkly.
“Dwarf man cheat me.”
“I will put my promise in writing,” Tyrion vowed.
Some illiterates held writing in disdain; others seemed to have a superstitious reverence
for the written word, as if it were some sort of magic. Fortunately, Mord was one of the
latter. The turnkey lowered the strap. “Writing down gold. Much gold.”
“Oh, much gold,” Tyrion assured him. “The purse is just a taste, my friend. My brother
wears armor of solid gold plate.” In truth, Jaime’s armor was gilded steel, but this oaf
would never know the difference.

Mord fingered his strap thoughtfully, but in the end, he relented and went to fetch paper
and ink. When the letter was written, the gaoler frowned at it suspiciously. “Now deliver
my message,” Tyrion urged.
He was shivering in his sleep when they came for him, late that night. Mord opened the
door but kept his silence. Ser Vardis Egen woke Tyrion with the point of his boot. “On
your feet, Imp. My lady wants to see you.”
Tyrion rubbed the sleep from his eyes and put on a grimace he scarcely felt. “No doubt
she does, but what makes you think I wish to see her?”
Ser Vardis frowned. Tyrion remembered him well from the years he had spent at King’s
Landing as the captain of the Hand’s household guard. A square, plain face, silver hair, a
heavy build, and no humor whatsoever. “Your wishes are not my concern. On your feet,
or I’ll have you carried.”
Tyrion clambered awkwardly to his feet. “A cold night,” he said casually, “and the High
Hall is so drafty. I don’t wish to catch a chill. Mord, if you would be so good, fetch my
cloak.”
The gaoler squinted at him, face dull with suspicion.
“My cloak,” Tyrion repeated. “The shadowskin you took from me for safekeeping. You
recall.”
“Get him the damnable cloak,” Ser Vardis said.
Mord did not dare grumble. He gave Tyrion a glare that promised future retribution, yet
he went for the cloak. When he draped it around his prisoner’s neck, Tyrion smiled. “My
thanks. I shall think of you whenever I wear it.” He flung the trailing end of the long fur
over his right shoulder, and felt warm for the first time in days. “Lead on, Ser Vardis.”
The High Hall of the Arryns was aglow with the light of fifty torches, burning in the
sconces along the walls. The Lady Lysa wore black silk, with the moon-and-falcon sewn
on her breast in pearls. Since she did not look the sort to join the Night’s Watch, Tyrion
could only imagine that she had decided mourning clothes were appropriate garb for a
confession. Her long auburn hair, woven into an elaborate braid, fell across her left
shoulder. The taller throne beside her was empty; no doubt the little Lord of the Eyrie
was off shaking in his sleep. Tyrion was thankful for that much, at least.
He bowed deeply and took a moment to glance around the hall. Lady Arryn had

summoned her knights and retainers to hear his confession, as he had hoped. He saw
Ser Brynden Tully’s craggy face and Lord Nestor Royce’s bluff one. Beside Nestor stood a
younger man with fierce black side-whiskers who could only be his heir, Ser Albar. Most
of the principal houses of the Vale were represented. Tyrion noted Ser Lyn Corbray,
slender as a sword, Lord Hunter with his gouty legs, the widowed Lady Waynwood
surrounded by her sons. Others sported sigils he did not know; broken lance, green
viper, burning tower, winged chalice.
Among the lords of the Vale were several of his companions from the high road; Ser
Rodrik Cassel, pale from half-healed wounds, stood with Ser Willis Wode beside him.
Marillion the singer had found a new woodharp. Tyrion smiled; whatever happened here
tonight, he did not wish it to happen in secret, and there was no one like a singer for
spreading a story near and far.
In the rear of the hall, Bronn lounged beneath a pillar. The freerider’s black eyes were
fixed on Tyrion, and his hand lay lightly on the pommel of his sword. Tyrion gave him a
long look, wondering . . .
Catelyn Stark spoke first. “You wish to confess your crimes, we are told.”
“I do, my lady,” Tyrion answered.
Lysa Arryn smiled at her sister. “The sky cells always break them. The gods can see them
there, and there is no darkness to hide in.”
“He does not look broken to me,” Lady Catelyn said.
Lady Lysa paid her no mind. “Say what you will,” she commanded Tyrion.
And now to roll the dice, he thought with another quick glance back at Bronn. “Where to
begin? I am a vile little man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting, my
lords and ladies. I have lain with whores, not once but hundreds of times. I have wished
my own lord father dead, and my sister, our gracious queen, as well.” Behind him,
someone chuckled. “I have not always treated my servants with kindness. I have
gambled. I have even cheated, I blush to admit. I have said many cruel and malicious
things about the noble lords and ladies of the court.” That drew outright laughter. “Once
I—”
“Silence!” Lysa Arryn’s pale round face had turned a burning pink. “What do you
imagine you are doing, dwarf?”
Tyrion cocked his head to one side. “Why, confessing my crimes, my lady—”

Catelyn Stark took a step forward. “You are accused of sending a hired knife to slay my
son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.”
Tyrion gave a helpless shrug. “Those crimes I cannot confess, I fear. I know nothing of
any murders.”
Lady Lysa rose from her weirwood throne. “I will not be made mock of. You have had
your little jape, Imp. I trust you enjoyed it. Ser Vardis, take him back to the
dungeon . . . but this time find him a smaller cell, with a floor more sharply sloped.”
“Is this how justice is done in the Vale?” Tyrion roared, so loudly that Ser Vardis froze
for an instant. “Does honor stop at the Bloody Gate? You accuse me of crimes, I deny
them, so you throw me into an open cell to freeze and starve.” He lifted his head, to give
them all a good look at the bruises Mord had left on his face. “Where is the king’s
justice? Is the Eyrie not part of the Seven Kingdoms? I stand accused, you say. Very well.
I demand a trial! Let me speak, and let my truth or falsehood be judged openly, in the
sight of gods and men.”
A low murmuring filled the High Hall. He had her, Tyrion knew. He was highborn, the
son of the most powerful lord in the realm, the brother of the queen. He could not be
denied a trial. Guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks had started toward Tyrion, but Ser Vardis
bid them halt and looked to Lady Lysa.
Her small mouth twitched in a petulant smile. “If you are tried and found to be guilty of
the crimes for which you stand accused, then by the king’s own laws, you must pay with
your life’s blood. We keep no headsman in the Eyrie, my lord of Lannister. Open the
Moon Door.”
The press of spectators parted. A narrow weirwood door stood between two slender
marble pillars, a crescent moon carved in the white wood. Those standing closest edged
backward as a pair of guardsmen marched through. One man removed the heavy bronze
bars; the second pulled the door inward. Their blue cloaks rose snapping from their
shoulders, caught in the sudden gust of wind that came howling through the open door.
Beyond was the emptiness of the night sky, speckled with cold uncaring stars.
“Behold the king’s justice,” Lysa Arryn said. Torch flames fluttered like pennons along
the walls, and here and there the odd torch guttered out.
“Lysa, I think this unwise,” Catelyn Stark said as the black wind swirled around the hall.
Her sister ignored her. “You want a trial, my lord of Lannister. Very well, a trial you shall

have. My son will listen to whatever you care to say, and you shall hear his judgment.
Then you may leave . . . by one door or the other.”
She looked so pleased with herself, Tyrion thought, and small wonder. How could a trial
threaten her, when her weakling son was the lord judge? Tyrion glanced at her Moon
Door. Mother, I want to see him fly! the boy had said. How many men had the snotnosed little wretch sent through that door already?
“I thank you, my good lady, but I see no need to trouble Lord Robert,” Tyrion said
politely. “The gods know the truth of my innocence. I will have their verdict, not the
judgment of men. I demand trial by combat.”
A storm of sudden laughter filled the High Hall of the Arryns. Lord Nestor Royce
snorted, Ser Willis chuckled, Ser Lyn Corbray guffawed, and others threw back their
heads and howled until tears ran down their faces. Marillion clumsily plucked a gay note
on his new woodharp with the fingers of his broken hand. Even the wind seemed to
whistle with derision as it came skirling through the Moon Door.
Lysa Arryn’s watery blue eyes looked uncertain. He had caught her off balance. “You
have that right, to be sure.”
The young knight with the green viper embroidered on his surcoat stepped forward and
went to one knee. “My lady, I beg the boon of championing your cause.”
“The honor should be mine,” old Lord Hunter said. “For the love I bore your lord
husband, let me avenge his death.”
“My father served Lord Jon faithfully as High Steward of the Vale,” Ser Albar Royce
boomed. “Let me serve his son in this.”
“The gods favor the man with the just cause,” said Ser Lyn Corbray, “yet often that turns
out to be the man with the surest sword. We all know who that is.” He smiled modestly.
A dozen other men all spoke at once, clamoring to be heard. Tyrion found it
disheartening to realize so many strangers were eager to kill him. Perhaps this had not
been such a clever plan after all.
Lady Lysa raised a hand for silence. “I thank you, my lords, as I know my son would
thank you if he were among us. No men in the Seven Kingdoms are as bold and true as
the knights of the Vale. Would that I could grant you all this honor. Yet I can choose only
one.” She gestured. “Ser Vardis Egen, you were ever my lord husband’s good right hand.
You shall be our champion.”

Ser Vardis had been singularly silent. “My lady,” he said gravely, sinking to one knee,
“pray give this burden to another, I have no taste for it. The man is no warrior. Look at
him. A dwarf, half my size and lame in the legs. It would be shameful to slaughter such a
man and call it justice.”
Oh, excellent, Tyrion thought. “I agree.”
Lysa glared at him. “You demanded a trial by combat.”
“And now I demand a champion, such as you have chosen for yourself. My brother
Jaime will gladly take my part, I know.”
“Your precious Kingslayer is hundreds of leagues from here,” snapped Lysa Arryn.
“Send a bird for him. I will gladly await his arrival.”
“You will face Ser Vardis on the morrow.”
“Singer,” Tyrion said, turning to Marillion, “when you make a ballad of this, be certain
you tell them how Lady Arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion, and sent him
forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face her finest knight.”
“I deny you nothing!” Lysa Arryn said, her voice peeved and shrill with irritation. “Name
your champion, Imp . . . if you think you can find a man to die for you.”
“If it is all the same to you, I’d sooner find one to kill for me.” Tyrion looked over the
long hall. No one moved. For a long moment he wondered if it had all been a colossal
blunder.
Then there was a stirring in the rear of the chamber. “I’ll stand for the dwarf,” Bronn
called out.

EDDARD
He dreamt an old dream, of three knights in white cloaks, and a tower long fallen, and
Lyanna in her bed of blood.
In the dream his friends rode with him, as they had in life. Proud Martyn Cassel, Jory’s
father; faithful Theo Wull; Ethan Glover, who had been Brandon’s squire; Ser Mark
Ryswell, soft of speech and gentle of heart; the crannogman, Howland Reed; Lord
Dustin on his great red stallion. Ned had known their faces as well as he knew his own
once, but the years leech at a man’s memories, even those he has vowed never to forget.
In the dream they were only shadows, grey wraiths on horses made of mist.
They were seven, facing three. In the dream as it had been in life. Yet these were no
ordinary three. They waited before the round tower, the red mountains of Dorne at their
backs, their white cloaks blowing in the wind. And these were no shadows; their faces
burned clear, even now. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on
his lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder. Ser Oswell
Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade with a whetstone. Across his whiteenameled helm, the black bat of his House spread its wings. Between them stood fierce
old Ser Gerold Hightower, the White Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
“I looked for you on the Trident,” Ned said to them.
“We were not there,” Ser Gerold answered.
“Woe to the Usurper if we had been,” said Ser Oswell.
“When King’s Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I
wondered where you were.”
“Far away,” Ser Gerold said, “or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false
brother would burn in seven hells.”
“I came down on Storm’s End to lift the siege,” Ned told them, “and the Lords Tyrell and
Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I
was certain you would be among them.”

“Our knees do not bend easily,” said Ser Arthur Dayne.
“Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought
you might have sailed with him.”
“Ser Willem is a good man and true,” said Ser Oswell.
“But not of the Kingsguard,” Ser Gerold pointed out. “The Kingsguard does not flee.”
“Then or now,” said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm.
“We swore a vow,” explained old Ser Gerold.
Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven
against three.
“And now it begins,” said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed
Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.
“No,” Ned said with sadness in his voice. “Now it ends.” As they came together in a rush
of steel and shadow, he could hear Lyanna screaming. “Eddard!” she called. A storm of
rose petals blew across a blood-streaked sky, as blue as the eyes of death.
“Lord Eddard,” Lyanna called again.
“I promise,” he whispered. “Lya, I promise . . . ”
“Lord Eddard,” a man echoed from the dark.
Groaning, Eddard Stark opened his eyes. Moonlight streamed through the tall windows
of the Tower of the Hand.
“Lord Eddard?” A shadow stood over the bed.
“How . . . how long?” The sheets were tangled, his leg splinted and plastered. A dull
throb of pain shot up his side.
“Six days and seven nights.” The voice was Vayon Poole’s. The steward held a cup to
Ned’s lips. “Drink, my lord.”
“What . . . ?”

“Only water. Maester Pycelle said you would be thirsty.”
Ned drank. His lips were parched and cracked. The water tasted sweet as honey.
“The king left orders,” Vayon Poole told him when the cup was empty. “He would speak
with you, my lord.”
“On the morrow,” Ned said. “When I am stronger.” He could not face Robert now. The
dream had left him weak as a kitten.
“My lord,” Poole said, “he commanded us to send you to him the moment you opened
your eyes.” The steward busied himself lighting a bedside candle.
Ned cursed softly. Robert was never known for his patience. “Tell him I’m too weak to
come to him. If he wishes to speak with me, I should be pleased to receive him here. I
hope you wake him from a sound sleep. And summon . . . ” He was about to say Jory
when he remembered. “Summon the captain of my guard.”
Alyn stepped into the bedchamber a few moments after the steward had taken his leave.
“My lord.”
“Poole tells me it has been six days,” Ned said. “I must know how things stand.”
“The Kingslayer is fled the city,” Alyn told him. “The talk is he’s ridden back to Casterly
Rock to join his father. The story of how Lady Catelyn took the Imp is on every lip. I have
put on extra guards, if it please you.”
“It does,” Ned assured him. “My daughters?”
“They have been with you every day, my lord. Sansa prays quietly, but Arya . . . ” He
hesitated. “She has not said a word since they brought you back. She is a fierce little
thing, my lord. I have never seen such anger in a girl.”
“Whatever happens,” Ned said, “I want my daughters kept safe. I fear this is only the
beginning.”
“No harm will come to them, Lord Eddard,” Alyn said. “I stake my life on that.”
“Jory and the others . . . ”
“I gave them over to the silent sisters, to be sent north to Winterfell. Jory would want to

lie beside his grandfather.”
It would have to be his grandfather, for Jory’s father was buried far to the south. Martyn
Cassel had perished with the rest. Ned had pulled the tower down afterward, and used
its bloody stones to build eight cairns upon the ridge. It was said that Rhaegar had
named that place the tower of joy, but for Ned it was a bitter memory. They had been
seven against three, yet only two had lived to ride away; Eddard Stark himself and the
little crannogman, Howland Reed. He did not think it omened well that he should dream
that dream again after so many years.
“You’ve done well, Alyn,” Ned was saying when Vayon Poole returned. The steward
bowed low. “His Grace is without, my lord, and the queen with him.”
Ned pushed himself up higher, wincing as his leg trembled with pain. He had not
expected Cersei to come. It did not bode well that she had. “Send them in, and leave us.
What we have to say should not go beyond these walls.” Poole withdrew quietly.
Robert had taken time to dress. He wore a black velvet doublet with the crowned stag of
Baratheon worked upon the breast in golden thread, and a golden mantle with a cloak of
black and gold squares. A flagon of wine was in his hand, his face already flushed from
drink. Cersei Lannister entered behind him, a jeweled tiara in her hair.
“Your Grace,” Ned said. “Your pardons. I cannot rise.”
“No matter,” the king said gruffly. “Some wine? From the Arbor. A good vintage.”
“A small cup,” Ned said. “My head is still heavy from the milk of the poppy.”
“A man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on his
shoulders,” the queen declared.
“Quiet, woman,” Robert snapped. He brought Ned a cup of wine. “Does the leg still pain
you?”
“Some,” Ned said. His head was swimming, but it would not do to admit to weakness in
front of the queen.
“Pycelle swears it will heal clean.” Robert frowned. “I take it you know what Catelyn has
done?”
“I do.” Ned took a small swallow of wine. “My lady wife is blameless, Your Grace. All she

did she did at my command.”
“I am not pleased, Ned,” Robert grumbled.
“By what right do you dare lay hands on my blood?” Cersei demanded. “Who do you
think you are?”
“The Hand of the King,” Ned told her with icy courtesy. “Charged by your own lord
husband to keep the king’s peace and enforce the king’s justice.”
“You were the Hand,” Cersei began, “but now—”
“Silence!” the king roared. “You asked him a question and he answered it.” Cersei
subsided, cold with anger, and Robert turned back to Ned. “Keep the king’s peace, you
say. Is this how you keep my peace, Ned? Seven men are dead . . . ”
“Eight,” the queen corrected. “Tregar died this morning, of the blow Lord Stark gave
him.”
“Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets,” the king said. “I will
not have it, Ned.”
“Catelyn had good reason for taking the Imp—”
“I said, I will not have it! To hell with her reasons. You will command her to release the
dwarf at once, and you will make your peace with Jaime.”
“Three of my men were butchered before my eyes, because Jaime Lannister wished to
chasten me. Am I to forget that?”
“My brother was not the cause of this quarrel,” Cersei told the king. “Lord Stark was
returning drunk from a brothel. His men attacked Jaime and his guards, even as his wife
attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad.”
“You know me better than that, Robert,” Ned said. “Ask Lord Baelish if you doubt me.
He was there.”
“I’ve talked to Littlefinger,” Robert said. “He claims he rode off to bring the gold cloaks
before the fighting began, but he admits you were returning from some whorehouse.”
“Some whorehouse? Damn your eyes, Robert, I went there to have a look at your

daughter! Her mother has named her Barra. She looks like that first girl you fathered,
when we were boys together in the Vale.” He watched the queen as he spoke; her face
was a mask, still and pale, betraying nothing.
Robert flushed. “Barra,” he grumbled. “Is that supposed to please me? Damn the girl. I
thought she had more sense.”
“She cannot be more than fifteen, and a whore, and you thought she had sense?” Ned
said, incredulous. His leg was beginning to pain him sorely. It was hard to keep his
temper. “The fool child is in love with you, Robert.”
The king glanced at Cersei. “This is no fit subject for the queen’s ears.”
“Her Grace will have no liking for anything I have to say,” Ned replied. “I am told the
Kingslayer has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.”
The king swirled the wine in his cup, brooding. He took a swallow. “No,” he said. “I want
no more of this. Jaime slew three of your men, and you five of his. Now it ends.”
“Is that your notion of justice?” Ned flared. “If so, I am pleased that I am no longer your
Hand.”
The queen looked to her husband. “If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen as he has
spoken to you—”
“Do you take me for Aerys?” Robert interrupted.
“I took you for a king. Jaime and Tyrion are your own brothers, by all the laws of
marriage and the bonds we share. The Starks have driven off the one and seized the
other. This man dishonors you with every breath he takes, and yet you stand there
meekly, asking if his leg pains him and would he like some wine.”
Robert’s face was dark with anger. “How many times must I tell you to hold your tongue,
woman?”
Cersei’s face was a study in contempt. “What a jape the gods have made of us two,” she
said. “By all rights, you ought to be in skirts and me in mail.”
Purple with rage, the king lashed out, a vicious backhand blow to the side of the head.
She stumbled against the table and fell hard, yet Cersei Lannister did not cry out. Her
slender fingers brushed her cheek, where the pale smooth skin was already reddening.
On the morrow the bruise would cover half her face. “I shall wear this as a badge of

honor,” she announced.
“Wear it in silence, or I’ll honor you again,” Robert vowed. He shouted for a guard. Ser
Meryn Trant stepped into the room, tall and somber in his white armor. “The queen is
tired. See her to her bedchamber.” The knight helped Cersei to her feet and led her out
without a word.
Robert reached for the flagon and refilled his cup. “You see what she does to me, Ned.”
The king seated himself, cradling his wine cup. “My loving wife. The mother of my
children.” The rage was gone from him now; in his eyes Ned saw something sad and
scared. “I should not have hit her. That was not . . . that was not kingly.” He stared down
at his hands, as if he did not quite know what they were. “I was always strong . . . no one
could stand before me, no one. How do you fight someone if you can’t hit them?”
Confused, the king shook his head. “Rhaegar . . . Rhaegar won, damn him. I killed him,
Ned, I drove the spike right through that black armor into his black heart, and he died at
my feet. They made up songs about it. Yet somehow he still won. He has Lyanna now,
and I have her.” The king drained his cup.
“Your Grace,” Ned Stark said, “we must talk . . . ”
Robert pressed his fingertips against his temples. “I am sick unto death of talk. On the
morrow I’m going to the kingswood to hunt. Whatever you have to say can wait until I
return.”
“If the gods are good, I shall not be here on your return. You commanded me to return to
Winterfell, remember?”
Robert stood up, grasping one of the bedposts to steady himself. “The gods are seldom
good, Ned. Here, this is yours.” He pulled the heavy silver hand clasp from a pocket in
the lining of his cloak and tossed it on the bed. “Like it or not, you are my Hand, damn
you. I forbid you to leave.”
Ned picked up the silver clasp. He was being given no choice, it seemed. His leg
throbbed, and he felt as helpless as a child. “The Targaryen girl—”
The king groaned. “Seven hells, don’t start with her again. That’s done, I’ll hear no more
of it.”
“Why would you want me as your Hand, if you refuse to listen to my counsel?”
“Why?” Robert laughed. “Why not? Someone has to rule this damnable kingdom. Put on
the badge, Ned. It suits you. And if you ever throw it in my face again, I swear to you, I’ll

pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.”

CATELYN
The eastern sky was rose and gold as the sun broke over the Vale of Arryn. Catelyn Stark
watched the light spread, her hands resting on the delicate carved stone of the
balustrade outside her window. Below her the world turned from black to indigo to
green as dawn crept across fields and forests. Pale white mists rose off Alyssa’s Tears,
where the ghost waters plunged over the shoulder of the mountain to begin their long
tumble down the face of the Giant’s Lance. Catelyn could feel the faint touch of spray on
her face.
Alyssa Arryn had seen her husband, her brothers, and all her children slain, and yet in
life she had never shed a tear. So in death, the gods had decreed that she would know no
rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale, where the men she had loved
were buried. Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now, and still no drop of the
torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below. Catelyn wondered how large a
waterfall her own tears would make when she died. “Tell me the rest of it,” she said.
“The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock,” Ser Rodrik Cassel answered from
the room behind her. “Your brother writes that he has sent riders to the Rock,
demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his intent, but he has had no answer. Edmure has
commanded Lord Vance and Lord Piper to guard the pass below the Golden Tooth. He
vows to you that he will yield no foot of Tully land without first watering it with
Lannister blood.”
Catelyn turned away from the sunrise. Its beauty did little to lighten her mood; it seemed
cruel for a day to dawn so fair and end so foul as this one promised to. “Edmure has sent
riders and made vows,” she said, “but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun. What of my
lord father?”
“The message made no mention of Lord Hoster, my lady.” Ser Rodrik tugged at his
whiskers. They had grown in white as snow and bristly as a thornbush while he was
recovering from his wounds; he looked almost himself again.
“My father would not have given the defense of Riverrun over to Edmure unless he was
very sick,” she said, worried. “I should have been woken as soon as this bird arrived.”
“Your lady sister thought it better to let you sleep, Maester Colemon told me.”

“I should have been woken,” she insisted.
“The maester tells me your sister planned to speak with you after the combat,” Ser
Rodrik said.
“Then she still plans to go through with this mummer’s farce?” Catelyn grimaced. “The
dwarf has played her like a set of pipes, and she is too deaf to hear the tune. Whatever
happens this morning, Ser Rodrik, it is past time we took our leave. My place is at
Winterfell with my sons. If you are strong enough to travel, I shall ask Lysa for an escort
to see us to Gulltown. We can take ship from there.”
“Another ship?” Ser Rodrik looked a shade green, yet he managed not to shudder. “As
you say, my lady.”
The old knight waited outside her door as Catelyn summoned the servants Lysa had
given her. If she spoke to her sister before the duel, perhaps she could change her mind,
she thought as they dressed her. Lysa’s policies varied with her moods, and her moods
changed hourly. The shy girl she had known at Riverrun had grown into a woman who
was by turns proud, fearful, cruel, dreamy, reckless, timid, stubborn, vain, and, above
all, inconstant.
When that vile turnkey of hers had come crawling to tell them that Tyrion Lannister
wished to confess, Catelyn had urged Lysa to have the dwarf brought to them privately,
but no, nothing would do but that her sister must make a show of him before half the
Vale. And now this . . .
“Lannister is my prisoner,” she told Ser Rodrik as they descended the tower stairs and
made their way through the Eyrie’s cold white halls. Catelyn wore plain grey wool with a
silvered belt. “My sister must be reminded of that.”
At the doors to Lysa’s apartments, they met her uncle storming out. “Going to join the
fool’s festival?” Ser Brynden snapped. “I’d tell you to slap some sense into your sister, if I
thought it would do any good, but you’d only bruise your hand.”
“There was a bird from Riverrun,” Catelyn began, “a letter from Edmure . . . ”
“I know, child.” The black fish that fastened his cloak was Brynden’s only concession to
ornament. “I had to hear it from Maester Colemon. I asked your sister for leave to take a
thousand seasoned men and ride for Riverrun with all haste. Do you know what she told
me? The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords, nor even one, Uncle, she said. You are
the Knight of the Gate. Your place is here.” A gust of childish laughter drifted through

the open doors behind him, and her uncle glanced darkly over his shoulder. “Well, I told
her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate. Black fish or no, I am
still a Tully. I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall.”
Catelyn could not pretend to surprise. “Alone? You know as well as I that you will never
survive the high road. Ser Rodrik and I are returning to Winterfell. Come with us, Uncle.
I will give you your thousand men. Riverrun will not fight alone.”
Brynden thought a moment, then nodded a brusque agreement. “As you say. It’s the long
way home, but I’m more like to get there. I’ll wait for you below.” He went striding off,
his cloak swirling behind him.
Catelyn exchanged a look with Ser Rodrik. They went through the doors to the high,
nervous sound of a child’s giggles.
Lysa’s apartments opened over a small garden, a circle of dirt and grass planted with
blue flowers and ringed on all sides by tall white towers. The builders had intended it as
a godswood, but the Eyrie rested on the hard stone of the mountain, and no matter how
much soil was hauled up from the Vale, they could not get a weirwood to take root here.
So the Lords of the Eyrie planted grass and scattered statuary amidst low, flowering
shrubs. It was there the two champions would meet to place their lives, and that of
Tyrion Lannister, into the hands of the gods.
Lysa, freshly scrubbed and garbed in cream velvet with a rope of sapphires and
moonstones around her milk-white neck, was holding court on the terrace overlooking
the scene of the combat, surrounded by her knights, retainers, and lords high and low.
Most of them still hoped to wed her, bed her, and rule the Vale of Arryn by her side.
From what Catelyn had seen during her stay at the Eyrie, it was a vain hope.
A wooden platform had been built to elevate Robert’s chair; there the Lord of the Eyrie
sat, giggling and clapping his hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blue-and-white
motley made two wooden knights hack and slash at each other. Pitchers of thick cream
and baskets of blackberries had been set out, and the guests were sipping a sweet orangescented wine from engraved silver cups. A fool’s festival, Brynden had called it, and
small wonder.
Across the terrace, Lysa laughed gaily at some jest of Lord Hunter’s, and nibbled a
blackberry from the point of Ser Lyn Corbray’s dagger. They were the suitors who stood
highest in Lysa’s favor . . . today, at least. Catelyn would have been hard-pressed to say
which man was more unsuitable. Eon Hunter was even older than Jon Arryn had been,
half-crippled by gout, and cursed with three quarrelsome sons, each more grasping than
the last. Ser Lyn was a different sort of folly; lean and handsome, heir to an ancient but

impoverished house, but vain, reckless, hot-tempered . . . and, it was whispered,
notoriously uninterested in the intimate charms of women.
When Lysa espied Catelyn, she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on
the cheek. “Isn’t it a lovely morning? The gods are smiling on us. Do try a cup of the
wine, sweet sister. Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it, from his own cellars.”
“Thank you, no. Lysa, we must talk.”
“After,” her sister promised, already beginning to turn away from her.
“Now.” Catelyn spoke more loudly than she’d intended. Men were turning to look. “Lysa,
you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly. Alive, the Imp has value. Dead, he is only
food for crows. And if his champion should prevail here—”
“Small chance of that, my lady,” Lord Hunter assured her, patting her shoulder with a
liver-spotted hand. “Ser Vardis is a doughty fighter. He will make short work of the
sellsword.”
“Will he, my lord?” Catelyn said coolly. “I wonder.” She had seen Bronn fight on the high
road; it was no accident that he had survived the journey while other men had died. He
moved like a panther, and that ugly sword of his seemed a part of his arm.
Lysa’s suitors were gathering around them like bees round a blossom. “Women
understand little of these things,” Ser Morton Waynwood said. “Ser Vardis is a knight,
sweet lady. This other fellow, well, his sort are all cowards at heart. Useful enough in a
battle, with thousands of their fellows around them, but stand them up alone and the
manhood leaks right out of them.”
“Say you have the truth of it, then,” Catelyn said with a courtesy that made her mouth
ache. “What will we gain by the dwarf’s death? Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig
that we gave his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain?”
“Behead the man,” Ser Lyn Corbray suggested. “When the Kingslayer receives the Imp’s
head, it will be a warning to him,”
Lysa gave an impatient shake of her waist-long auburn hair. “Lord Robert wants to see
him fly,” she said, as if that settled the matter. “And the Imp has only himself to blame.
It was he who demanded a trial by combat.”
“Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him, even if she’d wished to,” Lord Hunter
intoned ponderously.

Ignoring them all, Catelyn turned all her force on her sister. “I remind you, Tyrion
Lannister is my prisoner.”
“And I remind you, the dwarf murdered my lord husband!” Her voice rose. “He
poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless, and now I mean to see
him pay!” Whirling, her skirts swinging around her, Lysa stalked across the terrace. Ser
Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors excused themselves with cool nods and trailed
after her.
“Do you think he did?” Ser Rodrik asked her quietly when they were alone again.
“Murder Lord Jon, that is? The Imp still denies it, and most fiercely . . . ”
“I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn,” Catelyn replied, “but whether it was
Tyrion, or Ser Jaime, or the queen, or all of them together, I could not begin to say.”
Lysa had named Cersei in the letter she had sent to Winterfell, but now she seemed
certain that Tyrion was the killer . . . perhaps because the dwarf was here, while the
queen was safe behind the walls of the Red Keep, hundreds of leagues to the south.
Catelyn almost wished she had burned her sister’s letter before reading it.
Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. “Poison, well . . . that could be the dwarf’s work, true
enough. Or Cersei’s. It’s said poison is a woman’s weapon, begging your pardons, my
lady. The Kingslayer, now . . . I have no great liking for the man, but he’s not the sort.
Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his. Was it poison, my lady?”
Catelyn frowned, vaguely uneasy. “How else could they make it look a natural death?”
Behind her, Lord Robert shrieked with delight as one of the puppet knights sliced the
other in half, spilling a flood of red sawdust onto the terrace. She glanced at her nephew
and sighed. “The boy is utterly without discipline. He will never be strong enough to rule
unless he is taken away from his mother for a time.”
“His lord father agreed with you,” said a voice at her elbow. She turned to behold
Maester Colemon, a cup of wine in his hand. “He was planning to send the boy to
Dragonstone for fostering, you know . . . oh, but I’m speaking out of turn.” The apple of
his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maester’s chain. “I fear I’ve had too much
of Lord Hunter’s excellent wine. The prospect of bloodshed has my nerves all a-fray . . . ”
“You are mistaken, Maester,” Catelyn said. “It was Casterly Rock, not Dragonstone, and
those arrangements were made after the Hand’s death, without my sister’s consent.”
The maester’s head jerked so vigorously at the end of his absurdly long neck that he
looked half a puppet himself. “No, begging your forgiveness, my lady, but it was Lord

Jon who—”
A bell tolled loudly below them. High lords and serving girls alike broke off what they
were doing and moved to the balustrade. Below, two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks led
forth Tyrion Lannister. The Eyrie’s plump septon escorted him to the statue in the center
of the garden, a weeping woman carved in veined white marble, no doubt meant to be
Alyssa.
“The bad little man,” Lord Robert said, giggling. “Mother, can I make him fly? I want to
see him fly.”
“Later, my sweet baby,” Lysa promised him.
“Trial first,” drawled Ser Lyn Corbray, “then execution.”
A moment later the two champions appeared from opposite sides of the garden. The
knight was attended by two young squires, the sellsword by the Eyrie’s master-at-arms.
Ser Vardis Egen was steel from head to heel, encased in heavy plate armor over mail and
padded surcoat. Large circular rondels, enameled cream-and-blue in the moon-andfalcon sigil of House Arryn, protected the vulnerable juncture of arm and breast. A skirt
of lobstered metal covered him from waist to midthigh, while a solid gorget encircled his
throat. Falcon’s wings sprouted from the temples of his helm, and his visor was a
pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision.
Bronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight. He wore only a
shirt of black oiled ringmail over boiled leather, a round steel halfhelm with a
noseguard, and a mail coif. High leather boots with steel shinguards gave some
protection to his legs, and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of his gloves. Yet
Catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe, with a longer
reach . . . and Bronn was fifteen years younger, if she was any judge.
They knelt in the grass beneath the weeping woman, facing each other, with Lannister
between them. The septon removed a faceted crystal sphere from the soft cloth bag at his
waist. He lifted it high above his head, and the light shattered. Rainbows danced across
the Imp’s face. In a high, solemn, singsong voice, the septon asked the gods to look down
and bear witness, to find the truth in this man’s soul, to grant him life and freedom if he
was innocent, death if he was guilty. His voice echoed off the surrounding towers.
When the last echo had died away, the septon lowered his crystal and made a hasty
departure. Tyrion leaned over and whispered something in Bronn’s ear before the
guardsmen led him away. The sellsword rose laughing and brushed a blade of grass from

his knee.
Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, was fidgeting impatiently in
his elevated chair. “When are they going to fight?” he asked plaintively.
Ser Vardis was helped back to his feet by one of his squires. The other brought him a
triangular shield almost four feet tall, heavy oak dotted with iron studs. They strapped it
to his left forearm. When Lysa’s master-at-arms offered Bronn a similar shield, the
sellsword spat and waved it away. Three days growth of coarse black beard covered his
jaw and cheeks, but if he did not shave it was not for want of a razor; the edge of his
sword had the dangerous glimmer of steel that had been honed every day for hours, until
it was too sharp to touch.
Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand, and his squire placed a handsome double-edged
longsword in his grasp. The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a
mountain sky; its pommel was a falcon’s head, its crossguard fashioned into the shape of
wings. “I had that sword crafted for Jon in King’s Landing,” Lysa told her guests proudly
as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut. “He wore it whenever he sat the Iron
Throne in King Robert’s place. Isn’t it a lovely thing? I thought it only fitting that our
champion avenge Jon with his own blade.”
The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt, but it seemed to Catelyn that
Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword. Yet she said nothing;
she was weary of futile arguments with her sister.
“Make them fight!” Lord Robert called out.
Ser Vardis faced the Lord of the Eyrie and lifted his sword in salute. “For the Eyrie and
the Vale!”
Tyrion Lannister had been seated on a balcony across the garden, flanked by his guards.
It was to him that Bronn turned with a cursory salute.
“They await your command,” Lady Lysa said to her lord son.
“Fight!” the boy screamed, his arms trembling as they clutched at his chair.
Ser Vardis swiveled, bringing up his heavy shield. Bronn turned to face him. Their
swords rang together, once, twice, a testing. The sellsword backed off a step. The knight
came after, holding his shield before him. He tried a slash, but Bronn jerked back, just
out of reach, and the silver blade cut only air. Bronn circled to his right. Ser Vardis
turned to follow, keeping his shield between them. The knight pressed forward, placing

each foot carefully on the uneven ground. The sellsword gave way, a faint smile playing
over his lips. Ser Vardis attacked, slashing, but Bronn leapt away from him, hopping
lightly over a low, moss-covered stone. Now the sellsword circled left, away from the
shield, toward the knight’s unprotected side. Ser Vardis tried a hack at his legs, but he
did not have the reach. Bronn danced farther to his left. Ser Vardis turned in place.
“The man is craven,” Lord Hunter declared. “Stand and fight, coward! “ Other voices
echoed the sentiment.
Catelyn looked to Ser Rodrik. Her master-at-arms gave a curt shake of his head. “He
wants to make Ser Vardis chase him. The weight of armor and shield will tire even the
strongest man.”
She had seen men practice at their swordplay near every day of her life, had viewed half
a hundred tourneys in her time, but this was something different and deadlier: a dance
where the smallest misstep meant death. And as she watched, the memory of another
duel in another time came back to Catelyn Stark, as vivid as if it had been yesterday.
They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun. When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm
and breastplate and mail, he took off most of his armor. Petyr had begged her for a favor
he might wear, but she had turned him away. Her lord father promised her to Brandon
Stark, and so it was to him that she gave her token, a pale blue handscarf she had
embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun. As she pressed it into his hand, she
pleaded with him. “He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother. It would
grieve me to see him die.” And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a
Stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her.
That fight was over almost as soon as it began. Brandon was a man grown, and he drove
Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down the water stair, raining steel on him
with every step, until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds. “Yield!”
he called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, grimly.
When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon finally ended it, with a brutal
backhand cut that bit through Petyr’s rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs,
so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal. He looked at her as he fell
and murmured “Cat” as the bright blood came flowing out between his mailed fingers.
She thought she had forgotten that.
That was the last time she had seen his face . . . until the day she was brought before him
in King’s Landing.
A fortnight passed before Littlefinger was strong enough to leave Riverrun, but her lord
father forbade her to visit him in the tower where he lay abed. Lysa helped their maester

nurse him; she had been softer and shyer in those days. Edmure had called on him as
well, but Petyr had sent him away. Her brother had acted as Brandon’s squire at the
duel, and Littlefinger would not forgive that. As soon as he was strong enough to be
moved, Lord Hoster Tully sent Petyr Baelish away in a closed litter, to finish his healing
on the Fingers, upon the windswept jut of rock where he’d been born.
The ringing clash of steel on steel jarred Catelyn back to the present. Ser Vardis was
coming hard at Bronn, driving into him with shield and sword. The sellsword scrambled
backward, checking each blow, stepping lithely over rock and root, his eyes never leaving
his foe. He was quicker, Catelyn saw; the knight’s silvered sword never came near to
touching him, but his own ugly grey blade hacked a notch from Ser Vardis’s shoulder
plate.
The brief flurry of fighting ended as swiftly as it had begun when Bronn sidestepped and
slid behind the statue of the weeping woman. Ser Vardis lunged at where he had been,
striking a spark off the pale marble of Alyssa’s thigh.
“They’re not fighting good, Mother,” the Lord of the Eyrie complained. “I want them to
fight.”
“They will, sweet baby,” his mother soothed him. “The sellsword can’t run all day.”
Some of the lords on Lysa’s terrace were making wry jests as they refilled their wine
cups, but across the garden, Tyrion Lannister’s mismatched eyes watched the champions
dance as if there were nothing else in the world.
Bronn came out from behind the statue hard and fast, still moving left, aiming a twohanded cut at the knight’s unshielded right side. Ser Vardis blocked, but clumsily, and
the sellsword’s blade flashed upward at his head. Metal rang, and a falcon’s wing
collapsed with a crunch. Ser Vardis took a half step back to brace himself, raised his
shield. Oak chips flew as Bronn’s sword hacked at the wooden wall. The sellsword
stepped left again, away from the shield, and caught Ser Vardis across the stomach, the
razor edge of his blade leaving a bright gash when it bit into the knight’s plate.
Ser Vardis drove forward off his back foot, his own silver blade descending in a savage
arc. Bronn slammed it aside and danced away. The knight crashed into the weeping
woman, rocking her on her plinth. Staggered, he stepped backward, his head turning
this way and that as he searched for his foe. The slit visor of his helm narrowed his
vision.
“Behind you, ser!” Lord Hunter shouted, too late. Bronn brought his sword down with
both hands, catching Ser Vardis in the elbow of his sword arm. The thin lobstered metal

that protected the joint crunched. The knight grunted, turning, wrenching his weapon
up. This time Bronn stood his ground. The swords flew at each other, and their steel
song filled the garden and rang off the white towers of the Eyrie.
“Ser Vardis is hurt,” Ser Rodrik said, his voice grave.
Catelyn did not need to be told; she had eyes, she could see the bright finger of blood
running along the knight’s forearm, the wetness inside the elbow joint. Every parry was
a little slower and a little lower than the one before. Ser Vardis turned his side to his foe,
trying to use his shield to block instead, but Bronn slid around him, quick as a cat. The
sellsword seemed to be getting stronger. His cuts were leaving their marks now. Deep
shiny gashes gleamed all over the knight’s armor, on his right thigh, his beaked visor,
crossing on his breastplate, a long one along the front of his gorget. The moon-andfalcon rondel over Ser Vardis’s right arm was sheared clean in half, hanging by its strap.
They could hear his labored breath, rattling through the air holes in his visor.
Blind with arrogance as they were, even the knights and lords of the Vale could see what
was happening below them, yet her sister could not. “Enough, Ser Vardis!” Lady Lysa
called down. “Finish him now, my baby is growing tired.”
And it must be said of Ser Vardis Egen that he was true to his lady’s command, even to
the last. One moment he was reeling backward, half-crouched behind his scarred shield;
the next he charged. The sudden bull rush caught Bronn off balance. Ser Vardis crashed
into him and slammed the lip of his shield into the sellsword’s face. Almost, almost,
Bronn lost his feet . . . he staggered back, tripped over a rock, and caught hold of the
weeping woman to keep his balance. Throwing aside his shield, Ser Vardis lurched after
him, using both hands to raise his sword. His right arm was blood from elbow to fingers
now, yet his last desperate blow would have opened Bronn from neck to navel . . . if the
sellsword had stood to receive it.
But Bronn jerked back. Jon Arryn’s beautiful engraved silver sword glanced off the
marble elbow of the weeping woman and snapped clean a third of the way up the blade.
Bronn put his shoulder into the statue’s back. The weathered likeness of Alyssa Arryn
tottered and fell with a great crash, and Ser Vardis Egen went down beneath her.
Bronn was on him in a heartbeat, kicking what was left of his shattered rondel aside to
expose the weak spot between arm and breastplate. Ser Vardis was lying on his side,
pinned beneath the broken torso of the weeping woman. Catelyn heard the knight groan
as the sellsword lifted his blade with both hands and drove it down and in with all his
weight behind it, under the arm and through the ribs. Ser Vardis Egen shuddered and
lay still.

Silence hung over the Eyrie. Bronn yanked off his halfhelm and let it fall to the grass. His
lip was smashed and bloody where the shield had caught him, and his coal-black hair
was soaked with sweat. He spit out a broken tooth.
“Is it over, Mother?” the Lord of the Eyrie asked.
No, Catelyn wanted to tell him, it’s only now beginning.
“Yes,” Lysa said glumly, her voice as cold and dead as the captain of her guard.
“Can I make the little man fly now?”
Across the garden, Tyrion Lannister got to his feet. “Not this little man,” he said. “This
little man is going down in the turnip hoist, thank you very much.”
“You presume—” Lysa began.
“I presume that House Arryn remembers its own words,” the Imp said. “As High as
Honor.”
“You promised I could make him fly,” the Lord of the Eyrie screamed at his mother. He
began to shake.
Lady Lysa’s face was flushed with fury. “The gods have seen fit to proclaim him
innocent, child. We have no choice but to free him.” She lifted her voice. “Guards. Take
my lord of Lannister and his . . . creature here out of my sight. Escort them to the Bloody
Gate and set them free. See that they have horses and supplies sufficient to reach the
Trident, and make certain all their goods and weapons are returned to them. They shall
need them on the high road.”
“The high road,” Tyrion Lannister said. Lysa allowed herself a faint, satisfied smile. It
was another sort of death sentence, Catelyn realized. Tyrion Lannister must know that
as well. Yet the dwarf favored Lady Arryn with a mocking bow. “As you command, my
lady,” he said. “I believe we know the way.”

JON
You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained,” Ser Alliser Thorne announced when
they had all assembled in the yard. “Your hands were made for manure shovels, not for
swords, and if it were up to me, the lot of you would be set to herding swine. But last
night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad. One or two
may even be worth the price of piss. To make room for them, I have decided to pass eight
of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will.” He called out the names one by
one. “Toad. Stone Head. Aurochs. Lover. Pimple. Monkey. Ser Loon.” Last, he looked at
Jon. “And the Bastard.”
Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust his sword into the air. Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile
stare. “They will call you men of Night’s Watch now, but you are bigger fools than the
Mummer’s Monkey here if you believe that. You are boys still, green and stinking of
summer, and when the winter comes you will die like flies.” And with that, Ser Alliser
Thorne took his leave of them.
The other boys gathered round the eight who had been named, laughing and cursing and
offering congratulations. Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and
shouted, “Toad, of the Night’s Watch!” Yelling that a black brother needed a horse, Pyp
leapt onto Grenn’s shoulders, and they tumbled to the ground, rolling and punching and
hooting. Dareon dashed inside the armory and returned with a skin of sour red. As they
passed the wine from hand to hand, grinning like fools, Jon noticed Samwell Tarly
standing by himself beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard. Jon offered him
the skin. “A swallow of wine?”
Sam shook his head. “No thank you, Jon.”
“Are you well?”
“Very well, truly,” the fat boy lied. “I am so happy for you all.” His round face quivered as
he forced a smile. “You will be First Ranger someday, just as your uncle was.”
“Is,” Jon corrected. He would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead. Before he could say
more, Haider cried, “Here, you planning to drink that all yourself?” Pyp snatched the
skin from his hand and danced away, laughing. While Grenn seized his arm, Pyp gave
the skin a squeeze, and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face. Haider howled in

protest at the waste of good wine. Jon sputtered and struggled. Matthar and Jeren
climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs.
By the time he wrenched free, with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat,
Samwell Tarly had gone.
That night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion.
When Jon arrived at the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led him to the bench
near the fire. The older men clapped him on the arm in passing. The eight soon-to-be
brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs, garnished with
sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter. “From
the Lord Commander’s own table,” Bowen Marsh told them. There were salads of
spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and
sweet cream.
“Do you think they’ll keep us together?” Pyp wondered as they gorged themselves
happily.
Toad made a face. “I hope not. I’m sick of looking at those ears of yours.”
“Ho,” said Pyp. “Listen to the crow call the raven black. You’re certain to be a ranger,
Toad. They’ll want you as far from the castle as they can. If Mance Rayder attacks, lift
your visor and show your face, and he’ll run off screaming.”
Everyone laughed but Grenn. “I hope I’m a ranger.”
“You and everyone else,” said Matthar. Every man who wore the black walked the Wall,
and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense, but the rangers were the true
fighting heart of the Night’s Watch. It was they who dared ride beyond the Wall,
sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow
Tower, fighting wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears.
“Not everyone,” said Halder. “It’s the builders for me. What use would rangers be if the
Wall fell down?”
The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers,
the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the woodsmen to
clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the Wall. Once, it was
said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted
forest, dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher. Those
days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all they could do to ride the Wall from
Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what

repairs they could.
“The Old Bear’s no fool,” Dareon observed. “You’re certain to be a builder, and Jon’s
certain to be a ranger. He’s the best sword and the best rider among us, and his uncle
was the First before he . . . ” His voice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had
almost said.
“Benjen Stark is still First Ranger,” Jon Snow told him, toying with his bowl of
blueberries. The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle’s safe return, but not him.
He pushed away the berries, scarcely touched, and rose from the bench.
“Aren’t you going to eat those?” Toad asked.
“They’re yours.” Jon had hardly tasted Hobb’s great feast. “I could not eat another bite.”
He took his cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way out.
Pyp followed him. “Jon, what is it?”
“Sam,” he admitted. “He was not at table tonight.”
“It’s not like him to miss a meal,” Pyp said thoughtfully. “Do you suppose he’s taken ill?”
“He’s frightened. We’re leaving him.” He remembered the day he had left Winterfell, all
the bittersweet farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in his hair, Arya raining
kisses on him after he’d given her Needle. “Once we say our words, we’ll all have duties
to attend to. Some of us may be sent away, to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower. Sam will
remain in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming
up the kingsroad. Gods only know what they’ll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will
send them against him, first chance he gets.”
Pyp made a grimace. “You did all you could.”
“All we could wasn’t enough,” Jon said.
A deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin’s Tower for Ghost. The
direwolf walked beside him to the stables. Some of the more skittish horses kicked at
their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered. Jon saddled his mare, mounted, and
rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night. Ghost raced ahead of him,
flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye. Jon let him go. A wolf needed to hunt.
He had no destination in mind. He wanted only to ride. He followed the creek for a time,
listening to the icy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to the kingsroad.

It stretched out before him, narrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no
particular promise, yet the sight of it filled Jon Snow with a vast longing. Winterfell was
down that road, and beyond it Riverrun and King’s Landing and the Eyrie and so many
other places; Casterly Rock, the Isle of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, the hundred
islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria. All the places that Jon
would never see. The world was down that road . . . and he was here.
Once he swore his vow, the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon.
“I have not sworn yet,” he muttered. He was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay
the penalty for his crimes. He had come here freely, and he might leave freely . . . until
he said the words. He need only ride on, and he could leave it all behind. By the time the
moon was full again, he would be back in Winterfell with his brothers.
Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome
you. There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King’s Landing either. Even
his own mother had not had a place for him. The thought of her made him sad. He
wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her.
Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or
else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?
Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him. The fires of Castle Black
were hidden behind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the moon, vast and cold,
running from horizon to horizon.
He wheeled his horse around and started for home.
Ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord
Commander’s Tower. The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the
horse. Jon found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back. By the time
he reached the stables, he knew what he must do.
Maester Aemon’s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery. Aged and
frail, the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards, who tended to
his needs and helped him in his duties. The brothers joked that he had been given the
two ugliest men in the Night’s Watch; being blind, he was spared having to look at them.
Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink eyes like a mole. Chett had a wen
on his neck the size of a pigeon’s egg, and a face red with boils and pimples. Perhaps that
was why he always seemed so angry.
It was Chett who answered Jon’s knock. “I need to speak to Maester Aemon,” Jon told
him.

“The maester is abed, as you should be. Come back on the morrow and maybe he’ll see
you.” He began to shut the door.
Jon jammed it open with his boot. “I need to speak to him now. The morning will be too
late.”
Chett scowled. “The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night. Do you
know how old he is?”
“Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you,” Jon said. “Give him my
pardons. I would not disturb his rest if it were not important.”
“And if I refuse?”
Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door. “I can stand here all night if I must.”
The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him. “Wait in
the library. There’s wood. Start a fire. I won’t have the maester catching a chill on
account of you.”
Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon. The old man
was clad in his bed robe, but around his throat was the chain collar of his order. A
maester did not remove it even to sleep. “The chair beside the fire would be pleasant,” he
said when he felt the warmth on his face. When he was settled comfortably, Chett
covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door.
“I am sorry to have woken you, Maester,” Jon Snow said.
“You did not wake me,” Maester Aemon replied. “I find I need less sleep as I grow older,
and I am grown very old. I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times
fifty years past as if they were yesterday. The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome
diversion. So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come calling at this strange hour?”
“To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the
Night’s Watch.”
“This is no concern of Maester Aemon,” Chett complained.
“Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser
Thorne,” the maester said gently. “Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow,
as you surely know. Why then come to me?”

“The Lord Commander listens to you,” Jon told him. “And the wounded and the sick of
the Night’s Watch are in your charge.”
“And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?”
“He will be,” Jon promised, “unless you help.”
He told them all of it, even the part where he’d set Ghost at Rast’s throat. Maester
Aemon listened silently, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett’s face darkened with each
word. “Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance,” Jon finished. “He’s
hopeless with a sword. My sister Arya could tear him apart, and she’s not yet ten. If Ser
Alliser makes him fight, it’s only a matter of time before he’s hurt or killed.”
Chett could stand no more. “I’ve seen this fat boy in the common hall,” he said. “He is a
pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.”
“Maybe it is so,” Maester Aemon said. “Tell me, Chett, what would you have us do with
such a boy?”
“Leave him where he is,” Chett said. “The Wall is no place for the weak. Let him train
until he is ready, no matter how many years that takes. Ser Alliser shall make a man of
him or kill him, as the gods will.”
“That’s stupid,” Jon said. He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts. “I remember
once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat.”
Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly, his bony, wrinkled finger stroking the
heavy metal links. “Go on.”
“He told me that a maester’s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to
serve,” Jon said, remembering. “I asked why each link was a different metal. A silver
chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said. Maester Luwin laughed. A
maester forges his chain with study, he told me. The different metals are each a different
kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for
warcraft. And he said there were other meanings as well. The collar is supposed to
remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn’t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel,
but two links can’t make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper
and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the
like. A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people.”
Maester Aemon smiled. “And so?”

“The Night’s Watch needs all sorts too. Why else have rangers and stewards and
builders? Lord Randyll couldn’t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won’t either. You
can’t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn’t mean tin is
useless. Why shouldn’t Sam be a steward?”
Chett gave an angry scowl. “I’m a steward. You think it’s easy work, fit for cowards? The
order of stewards keeps the Watch alive. We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the
cows, gather firewood, cook the meals. Who do you think makes your clothing? Who
brings up supplies from the south? The stewards.”
Maester Aemon was gentler. “Is your friend a hunter?”
“He hates hunting,” Jon had to admit.
“Can he plow a field?” the maester asked. “Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could he
butcher a cow?”
“No.”
Chett gave a nasty laugh. “I’ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they’re put to
work. Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed. Give them an axe to
split logs, and they cut off their own foot.”
“I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone.”
“Yes?” Maester Aemon prompted.
Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry. “He could
help you,” he said quickly. “He can do sums, and he knows how to read and write. I
know Chett can’t read, and Clydas has weak eyes. Sam read every book in his father’s
library. He’d be good with the ravens too. Animals seem to like him. Ghost took to him
straight off. There’s a lot he could do, besides fighting. The Night’s Watch needs every
man. Why kill one, to no end? Make use of him instead.”
Maester Aemon closed his eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone
to sleep. Finally he said, “Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow. Your mind is as deft
as your blade, it would seem.”
“Does that mean . . . ”
“It means I shall think on what you have said,” the maester told him firmly. “And now, I

believe I am ready to sleep. Chett, show our young brother to the door.”

TYRION
They had taken shelter beneath a copse of aspens just off the high road. Tyrion was
gathering deadwood while their horses took water from a mountain stream. He stooped
to pick up a splintered branch and examined it critically. “Will this do? I am not
practiced at starting fires. Morrec did that for me.”
“A fire?” Bronn said, spitting. “Are you so hungry to die, dwarf? Or have you taken leave
of your senses? A fire will bring the clansmen down on us from miles around. I mean to
survive this journey, Lannister.”
“And how do you hope to do that?” Tyrion asked. He tucked the branch under his arm
and poked around through the sparse undergrowth, looking for more. His back ached
from the effort of bending; they had been riding since daybreak, when a stone-faced Ser
Lyn Corbray had ushered them through the Bloody Gate and commanded them never to
return.
“We have no chance of fighting our way back,” Bronn said, “but two can cover more
ground than ten, and attract less notice. The fewer days we spend in these mountains,
the more like we are to reach the riverlands. Ride hard and fast, I say. Travel by night
and hole up by day, avoid the road where we can, make no noise and light no fires.”
Tyrion Lannister sighed. “A splendid plan, Bronn. Try it, as you like . . . and forgive me if
I do not linger to bury you.”
“You think to outlive me, dwarf?” The sellsword grinned. He had a dark gap in his smile
where the edge of Ser Vardis Egen’s shield had cracked a tooth in half.
Tyrion shrugged. “Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a
mountain and crack your skull. I prefer to make my crossing slow and easy. I know you
love the taste of horse, Bronn, but if our mounts die under us this time, we’ll be trying to
saddle shadowcats . . . and if truth be told, I think the clans will find us no matter what
we do. Their eyes are all around us.” He swept a gloved hand over the high, wind-carved
crags that surrounded them.
Bronn grimaced. “Then we’re dead men, Lannister.”

“If so, I prefer to die comfortable,” Tyrion replied. “We need a fire. The nights are cold
up here, and hot food will warm our bellies and lift our spirits. Do you suppose there’s
any game to be had? Lady Lysa has kindly provided us with a veritable feast of salt beef,
hard cheese, and stale bread, but I would hate to break a tooth so far from the nearest
maester.”
“I can find meat.” Beneath a fall of black hair, Bronn’s dark eyes regarded Tyrion
suspiciously. “I should leave you here with your fool’s fire. If I took your horse, I’d have
twice the chance to make it through. What would you do then, dwarf?”
“Die, most like.” Tyrion stooped to get another stick.
“You don’t think I’d do it?”
“You’d do it in an instant, if it meant your life. You were quick enough to silence your
friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly.” Bronn had yanked back the
man’s head by the hair and driven the point of his dirk in under the ear, and afterward
told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had died of his wound.
“He was good as dead,” Bronn said, “and his moaning was bringing them down on us.
Chiggen would have done the same for me . . . and he was no friend, only a man I rode
with. Make no mistake, dwarf. I fought for you, but I do not love you.”
“It was your blade I needed,” Tyrion said, “not your love.” He dumped his armful of
wood on the ground.
Bronn grinned. “You’re bold as any sellsword, I’ll give you that. How did you know I’d
take your part?”
“Know?” Tyrion squatted awkwardly on his stunted legs to build the fire. “I tossed the
dice. Back at the inn, you and Chiggen helped take me captive. Why? The others saw it as
their duty, for the honor of the lords they served, but not you two. You had no lord, no
duty, and precious little honor, so why trouble to involve yourselves?” He took out his
knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of the sticks he’d gathered, to serve as
kindling. “Well, why do sellswords do anything? For gold. You were thinking Lady
Catelyn would reward you for your help, perhaps even take you into her service. Here,
that should do, I hope. Do you have a flint?”
Bronn slid two fingers into the pouch at his belt and tossed down a flint. Tyrion caught it
in the air.
“My thanks,” he said. “The thing is, you did not know the Starks. Lord Eddard is a

proud, honorable, and honest man, and his lady wife is worse. Oh, no doubt she would
have found a coin or two for you when this was all over, and pressed it in your hand with
a polite word and a look of distaste, but that’s the most you could have hoped for. The
Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them, and
if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum.” Tyrion struck the flint against his
dagger, trying for a spark. Nothing.
Bronn snorted. “You have a bold tongue, little man. One day someone is like to cut it out
and make you eat it.”
“Everyone tells me that.” Tyrion glanced up at the sellsword. “Did I offend you? My
pardons . . . but you are scum, Bronn, make no mistake. Duty, honor, friendship, what’s
that to you? No, don’t trouble yourself, we both know the answer. Still, you’re not stupid.
Once we reached the Vale, Lady Stark had no more need of you . . . but I did, and the one
thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold. When the moment came to toss the
dice, I was counting on your being smart enough to know where your best interest lay.
Happily for me, you did.” He slammed stone and steel together again, fruitlessly.
“Here,” said Bronn, squatting, “I’ll do it.” He took the knife and flint from Tyrion’s hands
and struck sparks on his first try. A curl of bark began to smolder.
“Well done,” Tyrion said. “Scum you may be, but you’re undeniably useful, and with a
sword in your hand you’re almost as good as my brother Jaime. What do you want,
Bronn? Gold? Land? Women? Keep me alive, and you’ll have it.”
Bronn blew gently on the fire, and the flames leapt up higher. “And if you die?”
“Why then, I’ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere,” Tyrion said, grinning. “The
gold ends when I do.”
The fire was blazing up nicely. Bronn stood, tucked the flint back into his pouch, and
tossed Tyrion his dagger. “Fair enough,” he said. “My sword’s yours, then . . . but don’t
go looking for me to bend the knee and m’lord you every time you take a shit. I’m no
man’s toady.”
“Nor any man’s friend,” Tyrion said. “I’ve no doubt you’d betray me as quick as you did
Lady Stark, if you saw a profit in it. If the day ever comes when you’re tempted to sell me
out, remember this, Bronn—I’ll match their price, whatever it is. I like living. And now,
do you think you could do something about finding us some supper?”
“Take care of the horses,” Bronn said, unsheathing the long dirk he wore at his hip. He
strode into the trees.

An hour later the horses had been rubbed down and fed, the fire was crackling away
merrily, and a haunch of a young goat was turning above the flames, spitting and
hissing. “All we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid,” Tyrion said.
“That, a woman, and another dozen swords,” Bronn said. He sat cross-legged beside the
fire, honing the edge of his longsword with an oilstone. There was something strangely
reassuring about the rasping sound it made when he drew it down the steel. “It will be
full dark soon,” the sellsword pointed out. “I’ll take first watch . . . for all the good it will
do us. It might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep.”
“Oh, I imagine they’ll be here long before it comes to sleep.” The smell of the roasting
meat made Tyrion’s mouth water.
Bronn watched him across the fire. “You have a plan,” he said flatly, with a scrape of
steel on stone.
“A hope, call it,” Tyrion said. “Another toss of the dice.”
“With our lives as the stake?”
Tyrion shrugged. “What choice do we have?” He leaned over the fire and sawed a thin
slice of meat from the kid. “Ahhhh,” he sighed happily as he chewed. Grease ran down
his chin. “A bit tougher than I’d like, and in want of spicing, but I’ll not complain too
loudly. If I were back at the Eyrie, I’d be dancing on a precipice in hopes of a boiled
bean.”
“And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold,” Bronn said.
“A Lannister always pays his debts.”
Even Mord had scarcely believed it when Tyrion tossed him the leather purse. The
gaoler’s eyes had gone big as boiled eggs as he yanked open the drawstring and beheld
the glint of gold. “I kept the silver,” Tyrion had told him with a crooked smile, “but you
were promised the gold, and there it is.” It was more than a man like Mord could hope to
earn in a lifetime of abusing prisoners. “And remember what I said, this is only a taste. If
you ever grow tired of Lady Arryn’s service, present yourself at Casterly Rock, and I’ll
pay you the rest of what I owe you.” With golden dragons spilling out of both hands,
Mord had fallen to his knees and promised that he would do just that.
Bronn yanked out his dirk and pulled the meat from the fire. He began to carve thick
chunks of charred meat off the bone as Tyrion hollowed out two heels of stale bread to

serve as trenchers. “If we do reach the river, what will you do then?” the sellsword asked
as he cut.
“Oh, a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine, for a start.” Tyrion held out his
trencher, and Bronn filled it with meat. “And then to Casterly Rock or King’s Landing, I
think. I have some questions that want answering, concerning a certain dagger.”
The sellsword chewed and swallowed. “So you were telling it true? It was not your knife?”
Tyrion smiled thinly. “Do I look a liar to you?”
By the time their bellies were full, the stars had come out and a halfmoon was rising over
the mountains. Tyrion spread his shadowskin cloak on the ground and stretched out
with his saddle for a pillow. “Our friends are taking their sweet time.”
“If I were them, I’d fear a trap,” Bronn said. “Why else would we be so open, if not to lure
them in?”
Tyrion chuckled. “Then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror.” He began to
whistle a tune.
“You’re mad, dwarf,” Bronn said as he cleaned the grease out from under his nails with
his dirk.
“Where’s your love of music, Bronn?”
“If it was music you wanted, you should have gotten the singer to champion you.”
Tyrion grinned. “That would have been amusing. I can just see him fending off Ser
Vardis with his woodharp.” He resumed his whistling. “Do you know this song?” he
asked.
“You hear it here and there, in inns and whorehouses.”
“Myrish. ‘The Seasons of My Love.’ Sweet and sad, if you understand the words. The first
girl I ever bedded used to sing it, and I’ve never been able to put it out of my head.”
Tyrion gazed up at the sky. It was a clear cold night and the stars shone down upon the
mountains as bright and merciless as truth. “I met her on a night like this,” he heard
himself saying. “Jaime and I were riding back from Lannisport when we heard a scream,
and she came running out into the road with two men dogging her heels, shouting
threats. My brother unsheathed his sword and went after them, while I dismounted to
protect the girl. She was scarcely a year older than I was, dark-haired, slender, with a

face that would break your heart. It certainly broke mine. Lowborn, half-starved,
unwashed . . . yet lovely. They’d torn the rags she was wearing half off her back, so I
wrapped her in my cloak while Jaime chased the men into the woods. By the time he
came trotting back, I’d gotten a name out of her, and a story. She was a crofter’s child,
orphaned when her father died of fever, on her way to . . . well, nowhere, really.
“Jaime was all in a lather to hunt down the men. It was not often outlaws dared prey on
travelers so near to Casterly Rock, and he took it as an insult. The girl was too frightened
to send off by herself, though, so I offered to take her to the closest inn and feed her
while my brother rode back to the Rock for help.
“She was hungrier than I would have believed. We finished two whole chickens and part
of a third, and drank a flagon of wine, talking. I was only thirteen, and the wine went to
my head, I fear. The next thing I knew, I was sharing her bed. If she was shy, I was shyer.
I’ll never know where I found the courage. When I broke her maidenhead, she wept, but
afterward she kissed me and sang her little song, and by morning I was in love.”
“You?” Bronn’s voice was amused.
“Absurd, isn’t it?” Tyrion began to whistle the song again. “I married her,” he finally
admitted.
“A Lannister of Casterly Rock wed to a crofter’s daughter,” Bronn said. “How did you
manage that?”
“Oh, you’d be astonished at what a boy can make of a few lies, fifty pieces of silver, and a
drunken septon. I dared not bring my bride home to Casterly Rock, so I set her up in a
cottage of her own, and for a fortnight we played at being man and wife. And then the
septon sobered and confessed all to my lord father.” Tyrion was surprised at how
desolate it made him feel to say it, even after all these years. Perhaps he was just tired.
“That was the end of my marriage.” He sat up and stared at the dying fire, blinking at the
light.
“He sent the girl away?”
“He did better than that,” Tyrion said. “First he made my brother tell me the truth. The
girl was a whore, you see. Jaime arranged the whole affair, the road, the outlaws, all of it.
He thought it was time I had a woman. He paid double for a maiden, knowing it would
be my first time.
“After Jaime had made his confession, to drive home the lesson, Lord Tywin brought my
wife in and gave her to his guards. They paid her fair enough. A silver for each man, how

many whores command that high a price? He sat me down in the corner of the barracks
and bade me watch, and at the end she had so many silvers the coins were slipping
through her fingers and rolling on the floor, she . . . ” The smoke was stinging his eyes.
Tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the fire, to gaze out into darkness. “Lord
Tywin had me go last,” he said in a quiet voice. “And he gave me a gold coin to pay her,
because I was a Lannister, and worth more.”
After a time he heard the noise again, the rasp of steel on stone as Bronn sharpened his
sword. “Thirteen or thirty or three, I would have killed the man who did that to me.”
Tyrion swung around to face him. “You may get that chance one day. Remember what I
told you. A Lannister always pays his debts.” He yawned. “I think I will try and sleep.
Wake me if we’re about to die.”
He rolled himself up in the shadowskin and shut his eyes. The ground was stony and
cold, but after a time Tyrion Lannister did sleep. He dreamt of the sky cell. This time he
was the gaoler, not the prisoner, big, with a strap in his hand, and he was hitting his
father, driving him back, toward the abyss . . .
“Tyrion.” Bronn’s warning was low and urgent.
Tyrion was awake in the blink of an eye. The fire had burned down to embers, and the
shadows were creeping in all around them. Bronn had raised himself to one knee, his
sword in one hand and his dirk in the other. Tyrion held up a hand: stay still, it said.
“Come share our fire, the night is cold,” he called out to the creeping shadows. “I fear
we’ve no wine to offer you, but you’re welcome to some of our goat.”
All movement stopped. Tyrion saw the glint of moonlight on metal. “Our mountain,” a
voice called out from the trees, deep and hard and unfriendly. “Our goat.”
“Your goat,” Tyrion agreed. “Who are you?”
“When you meet your gods,” a different voice replied, “say it was Gunthor son of Gurn of
the Stone Crows who sent you to them.” A branch cracked underfoot as he stepped into
the light; a thin man in a horned helmet, armed with a long knife.
“And Shagga son of Dolf.” That was the first voice, deep and deadly. A boulder shifted to
their left, and stood, and became a man. Massive and slow and strong he seemed,
dressed all in skins, with a club in his right hand and an axe in his left. He smashed them
together as he lumbered closer.
Other voices called other names, Conn and Torrek and Jaggot and more that Tyrion

forgot the instant he heard them; ten at least. A few had swords and knives; others
brandished pitchforks and scythes and wooden spears. He waited until they were done
shouting out their names before he gave them answer. “I am Tyrion son of Tywin, of the
Clan Lannister, the Lions of the Rock. We will gladly pay you for the goat we ate.”
“What do you have to give us, Tyrion son of Tywin?” asked the one who named himself
Gunthor, who seemed to be their chief.
“There is silver in my purse,” Tyrion told them. “This hauberk I wear is large for me, but
it should fit Conn nicely, and the battle-axe I carry would suit Shagga’s mighty hand far
better than that wood-axe he holds.”
“The halfman would pay us with our own coin,” said Conn.
“Conn speaks truly,” Gunthor said. “Your silver is ours. Your horses are ours. Your
hauberk and your battle-axe and the knife at your belt, those are ours too. You have
nothing to give us but your lives. How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?”
“In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden’s mouth around my cock, at the
age of eighty,” he replied.
The huge one, Shagga, laughed first and loudest. The others seemed less amused. “Conn,
take their horses,” Gunthor commanded. “Kill the other and seize the halfinan. He can
milk the goats and make the mothers laugh.”
Bronn sprang to his feet. “Who dies first?”
“No!” Tyrion said sharply. “Gunthor son of Gurn, hear me. My House is rich and
powerful. If the Stone Crows will see us safely through these mountains, my lord father
will shower you with gold.”
“The gold of a lowland lord is as worthless as a halfman’s promises,” Gunthor said.
“Half a man I may be,” Tyrion said, “yet I have the courage to face my enemies. What do
the Stone Crows do, but hide behind rocks and shiver with fear as the knights of the Vale
ride by?”
Shagga gave a roar of anger and clashed club against axe. Jaggot poked at Tyrion’s face
with the fire-hardened point of a long wooden spear. He did his best not to flinch. “Are
these the best weapons you could steal?” he said. “Good enough for killing sheep,
perhaps . . . if the sheep do not fight back. My father’s smiths shit better steel.”

“Little boyman,” Shagga roared, “will you mock my axe after I chop off your manhood
and feed it to the goats?”
But Gunthor raised a hand. “No. I would hear his words. The mothers go hungry, and
steel fills more mouths than gold. What would you give us for your lives, Tyrion son of
Tywin? Swords? Lances? Mail?”
“All that, and more, Gunthor son of Gurn,” Tyrion Lannister replied, smiling. “I will give
you the Vale of Arryn.”

EDDARD
Through the high narrow windows of the Red Keep’s cavernous throne room, the light of
sunset spilled across the floor, laying dark red stripes upon the walls where the heads of
dragons had once hung. Now the stone was covered with hunting tapestries, vivid with
greens and browns and blues, and yet still it seemed to Ned Stark that the only color in
the hall was the red of blood.
He sat high upon the immense ancient seat of Aegon the Conqueror, an ironwork
monstrosity of spikes and jagged edges and grotesquely twisted metal. It was, as Robert
had warned him, a hellishly uncomfortable chair, and never more so than now, with his
shattered leg throbbing more sharply every minute. The metal beneath him had grown
harder by the hour, and the fanged steel behind made it impossible to lean back. A king
should never sit easy, Aegon the Conqueror had said, when he commanded his armorers
to forge a great seat from the swords laid down by his enemies. Damn Aegon for his
arrogance, Ned thought sullenly, and damn Robert and his hunting as well.
“You are quite certain these were more than brigands?” Varys asked softly from the
council table beneath the throne. Grand Maester Pycelle stirred uneasily beside him,
while Littlefinger toyed with a pen. They were the only councillors in attendance. A
white hart had been sighted in the kingswood, and Lord Renly and Ser Barristan had
joined the king to hunt it, along with Prince Joffrey, Sandor Clegane, Balon Swann, and
half the court. So Ned must needs sit the Iron Throne in his absence.
At least he could sit. Save the council, the rest must stand respectfully, or kneel. The
petitioners clustered near the tall doors, the knights and high lords and ladies beneath
the tapestries, the smallfolk in the gallery, the mailed guards in their cloaks, gold or
grey: all stood.
The villagers were kneeling: men, women, and children, alike tattered and bloody, their
faces drawn by fear. The three knights who had brought them here to bear witness stood
behind them.
“Brigands, Lord Varys?” Ser Raymun Darry’s voice dripped scorn. “Oh, they were
brigands, beyond a doubt. Lannister brigands.”
Ned could feel the unease in the hall, as high lords and servants alike strained to listen.

He could not pretend to surprise. The west had been a tinderbox since Catelyn had
seized Tyrion Lannister. Both Riverrun and Casterly Rock had called their banners, and
armies were massing in the pass below the Golden Tooth. It had only been a matter of
time until the blood began to flow. The sole question that remained was how best to
stanch the wound.
Sad-eyed Ser Karyl Vance, who would have been handsome but for the winestain
birthmark that discolored his face, gestured at the kneeling villagers. “This is all the
remains of the holdfast of Sherrer, Lord Eddard. The rest are dead, along with the
people of Wendish Town and the Mummer’s Ford.”
“Rise,” Ned commanded the villagers. He never trusted what a man told him from his
knees. “All of you, up.”
In ones and twos, the holdfast of Sherrer struggled to its feet. One ancient needed to be
helped, and a young girl in a bloody dress stayed on her knees, staring blankly at Ser
Arys Oakheart, who stood by the foot of the throne in the white armor of the Kingsguard,
ready to protect and defend the king . . . or, Ned supposed, the King’s Hand.
“Joss,” Ser Raymun Darry said to a plump balding man in a brewer’s apron. “Tell the
Hand what happened at Sherrer.”
Joss nodded. “If it please His Grace—”
“His Grace is hunting across the Blackwater,” Ned said, wondering how a man could live
his whole life a few days ride from the Red Keep and still have no notion what his king
looked like. Ned was clad in a white linen doublet with the direwolf of Stark on the
breast; his black wool cloak was fastened at the collar by his silver hand of office. Black
and white and grey, all the shades of truth. “I am Lord Eddard Stark, the King’s Hand.
Tell me who you are and what you know of these raiders.”
“I keep . . . I kept . . . I kept an alehouse, m’lord, in Sherrer, by the stone bridge. The
finest ale south of the Neck, everyone said so, begging your pardons, m’lord. It’s gone
now like all the rest, m’lord. They come and drank their fill and spilled the rest before
they fired my roof, and they would of spilled my blood too, if they’d caught me. M’lord.”
“They burnt us out,” a farmer beside him said. “Come riding in the dark, up from the
south, and fired the fields and the houses alike, killing them as tried to stop them. They
weren’t no raiders, though, m’lord. They had no mind to steal our stock, not these, they
butchered my milk cow where she stood and left her for the flies and the crows.”
“They rode down my ’prentice boy,” said a squat man with a smith’s muscles and a

bandage around his head. He had put on his finest clothes to come to court, but his
breeches were patched, his cloak travel-stained and dusty. “Chased him back and forth
across the fields on their horses, poking at him with their lances like it was a game, them
laughing and the boy stumbling and screaming till the big one pierced him clean
through.”
The girl on her knees craned her head up at Ned, high above her on the throne. “They
killed my mother too, Your Grace. And they . . . they . . . ” Her voice trailed off, as if she
had forgotten what she was about to say. She began to sob.
Ser Raymun Darry took up the tale. “At Wendish Town, the people sought shelter in
their holdfast, but the walls were timbered. The raiders piled straw against the wood and
burnt them all alive. When the Wendish folk opened their gates to flee the fire, they shot
them down with arrows as they came running out, even women with suckling babes.”
“Oh, dreadful,” murmured Varys. “How cruel can men be?”
“They would of done the same for us, but the Sherrer holdfast’s made of stone,” Joss
said. “Some wanted to smoke us out, but the big one said there was riper fruit upriver,
and they made for the Mummer’s Ford.”
Ned could feel cold steel against his fingers as he leaned forward. Between each finger
was a blade, the points of twisted swords fanning out like talons from arms of the
throne. Even after three centuries, some were still sharp enough to cut. The Iron Throne
was full of traps for the unwary. The songs said it had taken a thousand blades to make
it, heated white-hot in the furnace breath of Balerion the Black Dread. The hammering
had taken fifty-nine days. The end of it was this hunched black beast made of razor
edges and barbs and ribbons of sharp metal; a chair that could kill a man, and had, if the
stories could be believed.
What Eddard Stark was doing sitting there he would never comprehend, yet there he sat,
and these people looked to him for justice. “What proof do you have that these were
Lannisters?” he asked, trying to keep his fury under control. “Did they wear crimson
cloaks or fly a lion banner?”
“Even Lannisters are not so blind stupid as that,” Ser Marq Piper snapped. He was a
swaggering bantam rooster of a youth, too young and too hot-blooded for Ned’s taste,
though a fast friend of Catelyn’s brother, Edmure Tully.
“Every man among them was mounted and mailed, my lord,” Ser Karyl answered calmly.
“They were armed with steel-tipped lances and longswords, with battle-axes for the
butchering.” He gestured toward one of the ragged survivors. “You. Yes, you, no one’s

going to hurt you. Tell the Hand what you told me.”
The old man bobbed his head. “Concerning their horses,” he said, “it were warhorses
they rode. Many a year I worked in old Ser Willum’s stables, so I knows the difference.
Not a one of these ever pulled a plow, gods bear witness if I’m wrong.”
“Well-mounted brigands,” observed Littlefinger. “Perhaps they stole the horses from the
last place they raided.”
“How many men were there in this raiding party?” Ned asked.
“A hundred, at the least,” Joss answered, in the same instant as the bandaged smith said,
“Fifty,” and the grandmother behind him, “Hunnerds and hunnerds, m’lord, an army
they was.”
“You are more right than you know, goodwoman,” Lord Eddard told her. “You say they
flew no banners. What of the armor they wore? Did any of you note ornaments or
decorations, devices on shield or helm?”
The brewer, Joss, shook his head. “It grieves me, m’lord, but no, the armor they showed
us was plain, only . . . the one who led them, he was armored like the rest, but there was
no mistaking him all the same. It was the size of him, m’lord. Those as say the giants are
all dead never saw this one, I swear. Big as an ox he was, and a voice like stone breaking.”
“The Mountain!” Ser Marq said loudly. “Can any man doubt it? This was Gregor
Clegane’s work.”
Ned heard muttering from beneath the windows and the far end of the hall. Even in the
galley, nervous whispers were exchanged. High lords and smallfolk alike knew what it
could mean if Ser Marq was proved right. Ser Gregor Clegane stood bannerman to Lord
Tywin Lannister.
He studied the frightened faces of the villagers. Small wonder they had been so fearful;
they had thought they were being dragged here to name Lord Tywin a red-handed
butcher before a king who was his son by marriage. He wondered if the knights had
given them a choice.
Grand Maester Pycelle rose ponderously from the council table, his chain of office
clinking. “Ser Marq, with respect, you cannot know that this outlaw was Ser Gregor.
There are many large men in the realm.”
“As large as the Mountain That Rides?” Ser Karyl said. “I have never met one.”

“Nor has any man here,” Ser Raymun added hotly. “Even his brother is a pup beside
him. My lords, open your eyes. Do you need to see his seal on the corpses? It was
Gregor.”
“Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?” Pycelle asked. “By the grace of his liege lord, he
holds a stout keep and lands of his own. The man is an anointed knight.”
“A false knight!” Ser Marq said. “Lord Tywin’s mad dog.”
“My lord Hand,” Pycelle declared in a stiff voice, “I urge you to remind this good knight
that Lord Tywin Lannister is the father of our own gracious queen.”
“Thank you, Grand Maester Pycelle,” Ned said. “I fear we might have forgotten that if
you had not pointed it out.”
From his vantage point atop the throne, he could see men slipping out the door at the far
end of the hall. Hares going to ground, he supposed . . . or rats off to nibble the queen’s
cheese. He caught a glimpse of Septa Mordane in the gallery, with his daughter Sansa
beside her. Ned felt a flash of anger; this was no place for a girl. But the septa could not
have known that today’s court would be anything but the usual tedious business of
hearing petitions, settling disputes between rival holdfasts, and adjudicating the
placement of boundary stones.
At the council table below, Petyr Baelish lost interest in his quill and leaned forward.
“Ser Marq, Ser Karyl, Ser Raymun—perhaps I might ask you a question? These holdfasts
were under your protection. Where were you when all this slaughtering and burning was
going on?”
Ser Karyl Vance answered. “I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden
Tooth, as was Ser Marq. When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully, he
sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and
bring them to the king.”
Ser Raymun Darry spoke up. “Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun with all my
strength. I was camped across the river from his walls, awaiting his commands, when
the word reached me. By the time I could return to my own lands, Clegane and his
vermin were back across the Red Fork, riding for Lannister’s hills.”
Littlefinger stroked the point of his beard thoughtfully. “And if they come again, ser?”
“If they come again, we’ll use their blood to water the fields they burnt,” Ser Marq Piper

declared hotly.
“Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a day’s ride of the
border,” Ser Karyl explained. “The next raider will not have such an easy time of it.”
And that may be precisely what Lord Tywin wants, Ned thought to himself, to bleed off
strength from Riverrun, goad the boy into scattering his swords. His wife’s brother was
young, and more gallant than wise. He would try to hold every inch of his soil, to defend
every man, woman, and child who named him lord, and Tywin Lannister was shrewd
enough to know that.
“If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm,” Lord Petyr was saying, “what then do
you ask of the throne?”
“The lords of the Trident keep the king’s peace,” Ser Raymun Darry said. “The
Lannisters have broken it. We ask leave to answer them, steel for steel. We ask justice for
the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish Town and the Mummer’s Ford.”
“Edmure agrees, we must pay Gregor Clegane back his bloody coin,” Ser Marq declared,
“but old Lord Hoster commanded us to come here and beg the king’s leave before we
strike.”
Thank the gods for old Lord Hoster, then. Tywin Lannister was as much fox as lion. If
indeed he’d sent Ser Gregor to burn and pillage—and Ned did not doubt that he had—
he’d taken care to see that he rode under cover of night, without banners, in the guise of
a common brigand. Should Riverrun strike back, Cersei and her father would insist that
it had been the Tullys who broke the king’s peace, not the Lannisters. The gods only
knew what Robert would believe.
Grand Maester Pycelle was on his feet again. “My lord Hand, if these good folk believe
that Ser Gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape, let them go to his liege
lord and make their complaint. These crimes are no concern of the throne. Let them seek
Lord Tywin’s justice.”
“It is all the king’s justice,” Ned told him. “North, south, east, or west, all we do we do in
Robert’s name.”
“The king’s justice,” Grand Maester Pycelle said. “So it is, and so we should defer this
matter until the king—”
“The king is hunting across the river and may not return for days,” Lord Eddard said.
“Robert bid me to sit here in his place, to listen with his ears, and to speak with his voice.

I mean to do just that . . . though I agree that he must be told.” He saw a familiar face
beneath the tapestries. “Ser Robar.”
Ser Robar Royce stepped forward and bowed. “My lord.”
“Your father is hunting with the king,” Ned said. “Will you bring them word of what was
said and done here today?”
“At once, my lord.”
“Do we have your leave to take our vengeance against Ser Gregor, then?” Marq Piper
asked the throne.
“Vengeance?” Ned said. “I thought we were speaking of justice. Burning Clegane’s fields
and slaughtering his people will not restore the king’s peace, only your injured pride.”
He glanced away before the young knight could voice his outraged protest, and
addressed the villagers. “People of Sherrer, I cannot give you back your homes or your
crops, nor can I restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you some small measure
of justice, in the name of our king, Robert.”
Every eye in the hall was fixed on him, waiting. Slowly Ned struggled to his feet, pushing
himself up from the throne with the strength of his arms, his shattered leg screaming
inside its cast. He did his best to ignore the pain; it was no moment to let them see his
weakness. “The First Men believed that the judge who called for death should wield the
sword, and in the north we hold to that still. I mislike sending another to do my
killing . . . yet it seems I have no choice.” He gestured at his broken leg.
“Lord Eddard!” The shout came from the west side of the hall as a handsome stripling of
a boy strode forth boldly. Out of his armor, Ser Loras Tyrell looked even younger than
his sixteen years. He wore pale blue silk, his belt a linked chain of golden roses, the sigil
of his House. “I beg you the honor of acting in your place. Give this task to me, my lord,
and I swear I shall not fail you.”
Littlefinger chuckled. “Ser Loras, if we send you off alone, Ser Gregor will send us back
your head with a plum stuffed in that pretty mouth of yours. The Mountain is not the
sort to bend his neck to any man’s justice.”
“I do not fear Gregor Clegane,” Ser Loras said haughtily.
Ned eased himself slowly back onto the hard iron seat of Aegon’s misshapen throne. His
eyes searched the faces along the wall. “Lord Beric,” he called out. “Thoros of Myr. Ser
Gladden. Lord Lothar.” The men named stepped forward one by one. “Each of you is to

assemble twenty men, to bring my word to Gregor’s keep. Twenty of my own guards
shall go with you. Lord Beric Dondarrion, you shall have the command, as befits your
rank.”
The young lord with the red-gold hair bowed. “As you command, Lord Eddard.”
Ned raised his voice, so it carried to the far end of the throne room. “In the name of
Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the
Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by
the word of Eddard of the House Stark, his Hand, I charge you to ride to the westlands
with all haste, to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king’s flag, and there bring
the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane, and to all those who shared in his
crimes. I denounce him, and attaint him, and strip him of all rank and titles, of all lands
and incomes and holdings, and do sentence him to death. May the gods take pity on his
soul.”
When the echo of his words had died away, the Knight of Flowers seemed perplexed.
“Lord Eddard, what of me?”
Ned looked down on him. From on high, Loras Tyrell seemed almost as young as Robb.
“No one doubts your valor, Ser Loras, but we are about justice here, and what you seek is
vengeance.” He looked back to Lord Beric. “Ride at first light. These things are best done
quickly.” He held up a hand. “The throne will hear no more petitions today.”
Alyn and Porther climbed the steep iron steps to help him back down. As they made
their descent, he could feel Loras Tyrell’s sullen stare, but the boy had stalked away
before Ned reached the floor of the throne room.
At the base of the Iron Throne, Varys was gathering papers from the council table.
Littlefinger and Grand Maester Pycelle had already taken their leave. “You are a bolder
man than I, my lord,” the eunuch said softly.
“How so, Lord Varys?” Ned asked brusquely. His leg was throbbing, and he was in no
mood for word games.
“Had it been me up there, I should have sent Ser Loras. He so wanted to go . . . and a
man who has the Lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the Tyrells his
friends.”
“Ser Loras is young,” said Ned. “I daresay he will outgrow the disappointment.”
“And Ser Ilyn?” The eunuch stroked a plump, powdered cheek. “He is the King’s Justice,

after all. Sending other men to do his office . . . some might construe that as a grave
insult.”
“No slight was intended.” In truth, Ned did not trust the mute knight, though perhaps
that was only because he misliked executioners. “I remind you, the Paynes are
bannermen to House Lannister. I thought it best to choose men who owed Lord Tywin
no fealty.”
“Very prudent, no doubt,” Varys said. “Still, I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the back of the
hall, staring at us with those pale eyes of his, and I must say, he did not look pleased,
though to be sure it is hard to tell with our silent knight. I hope he outgrows his
disappointment as well. He does so love his work . . . ”

SANSA
He wouldn’t send Ser Loras,” Sansa told Jeyne Poole that night as they shared a cold
supper by lamplight. “I think it was because of his leg.”
Lord Eddard had taken his supper in his bedchamber with Alyn, Harwin, and Vayon
Poole, the better to rest his broken leg, and Septa Mordane had complained of sore feet
after standing in the gallery all day. Arya was supposed to join them, but she was late
coming back from her dancing lesson.
“His leg?” Jeyne said uncertainly. She was a pretty, dark-haired girl of Sansa’s own age.
“Did Ser Loras hurt his leg?”
“Not his leg,” Sansa said, nibbling delicately at a chicken leg. “Father’s leg, silly. It hurts
him ever so much, it makes him cross. Otherwise I’m certain he would have sent Ser
Loras.”
Her father’s decision still bewildered her. When the Knight of Flowers had spoken up,
she’d been sure she was about to see one of Old Nan’s stories come to life. Ser Gregor
was the monster and Ser Loras the true hero who would slay him. He even looked a true
hero, so slim and beautiful, with golden roses around his slender waist and his rich
brown hair tumbling down into his eyes. And then Father had refused him! It had upset
her more than she could tell. She had said as much to Septa Mordane as they descended
the stairs from the gallery, but the septa had only told her it was not her place to
question her lord father’s decisions.
That was when Lord Baelish had said, “Oh, I don’t know, Septa. Some of her lord father’s
decisions could do with a bit of questioning. The young lady is as wise as she is lovely.”
He made a sweeping bow to Sansa, so deep she was not quite sure if she was being
complimented or mocked.
Septa Mordane had been very upset to realize that Lord Baelish had overheard them.
“The girl was just talking, my lord,” she’d said. “Foolish chatter. She meant nothing by
the comment.”
Lord Baelish stroked his little pointed beard and said, “Nothing? Tell me, child, why
would you have sent Ser Loras?”

Sansa had no choice but to explain about heroes and monsters. The king’s councillor
smiled. “Well, those are not the reasons I’d have given, but . . . ” He had touched her
cheek, his thumb lightly tracing the line of a cheekbone. “Life is not a song, sweetling.
You may learn that one day to your sorrow.”
Sansa did not feel like telling all that to Jeyne, however; it made her uneasy just to think
back on it.
“Ser Ilyn’s the King’s Justice, not Ser Loras,” Jcyne said. “Lord Eddard should have sent
him.”
Sansa shuddered. Every time she looked at Ser Ilyn Payne, she shivered. He made her
feel as though something dead were slithering over her naked skin. “Ser Ilyn’s almost
like a second monster. I’m glad Father didn’t pick him.”
“Lord Beric is as much a hero as Ser Loras. He’s ever so brave and gallant.”
“I suppose,” Sansa said doubtfully. Beric Dondarrion was handsome enough, but he was
awfully old, almost twenty-two; the Knight of Flowers would have been much better. Of
course, Jeyne had been in love with Lord Beric ever since she had first glimpsed him in
the lists. Sansa thought she was being silly; Jeyne was only a steward’s daughter, after
all, and no matter how much she mooned after him, Lord Beric would never look at
someone so far beneath him, even if she hadn’t been half his age.
It would have been unkind to say so, however, so Sansa took a sip of milk and changed
the subject. “I had a dream that Joffrey would be the one to take the white hart,” she
said. It had been more of a wish, actually, but it sounded better to call it a dream.
Everyone knew that dreams were prophetic. White harts were supposed to be very rare
and magical, and in her heart she knew her gallant prince was worthier than his drunken
father.
“A dream? Truly? Did Prince Joffrey just go up to it and touch it with his bare hand and
do it no harm?”
“No,” Sansa said. “He shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for me.” In the
songs, the knights never killed magical beasts, they just went up to them and touched
them and did them no harm, but she knew Joffrey liked hunting, especially the killing
part. Only animals, though. Sansa was certain her prince had no part in murdering Jory
and those other poor men; that had been his wicked uncle, the Kingslayer. She knew her
father was still angry about that, but it wasn’t fair to blame Joff. That would be like
blaming her for something that Arya had done.

“I saw your sister this afternoon,” Jeyne blurted out, as if she’d been reading Sansa’s
thoughts. “She was walking through the stables on her hands. Why would she do a thing
like that?”
“I’m sure I don’t know why Arya does anything.” Sansa hated stables, smelly places full
of manure and flies. Even when she went riding, she liked the boy to saddle the horse
and bring it to her in the yard. “Do you want to hear about the court or not?”
“I do,” Jeyne said.
“There was a black brother,” Sansa said, “begging men for the Wall, only he was kind of
old and smelly.” She hadn’t liked that at all. She had always imagined the Night’s Watch
to be men like Uncle Benjen. In the songs, they were called the black knights of the Wall.
But this man had been crookbacked and hideous, and he looked as though he might have
lice. If this was what the Night’s Watch was truly like, she felt sorry for her bastard half
brother, Jon. “Father asked if there were any knights in the hall who would do honor to
their houses by taking the black, but no one came forward, so he gave this Yoren his pick
of the king’s dungeons and sent him on his way. And later these two brothers came
before him, freeriders from the Dornish Marches, and pledged their swords to the
service of the king. Father accepted their oaths . . . ”
Jeyne yawned. “Are there any lemon cakes?”
Sansa did not like being interrupted, but she had to admit, lemon cakes sounded more
interesting than most of what had gone on in the throne room. “Let’s see,” she said.
The kitchen yielded no lemon cakes, but they did find half of a cold strawberry pie, and
that was almost as good. They ate it on the tower steps, giggling and gossiping and
sharing secrets, and Sansa went to bed that night feeling almost as wicked as Arya.
The next morning she woke before first light and crept sleepily to her window to watch
Lord Beric form up his men. They rode out as dawn was breaking over the city, with
three banners going before them; the crowned stag of the king flew from the high staff,
the direwolf of Stark and Lord Beric’s own forked lightning standard from shorter poles.
It was all so exciting, a song come to life; the clatter of swords, the flicker of torchlight,
banners dancing in the wind, horses snorting and whinnying, the golden glow of sunrise
slanting through the bars of the portcullis as it jerked upward. The Winterfell men
looked especially fine in their silvery mail and long grey cloaks.
Alyn carried the Stark banner. When she saw him rein in beside Lord Beric to exchange
words, it made Sansa feel ever so proud. Alyn was handsomer than Jory had been; he
was going to be a knight one day.

The Tower of the Hand seemed so empty after they left that Sansa was even pleased to
see Arya when she went down to break her fast. “Where is everyone?” her sister wanted
to know as she ripped the skin from a blood orange. “Did Father send them to hunt
down Jaime Lannister?”
Sansa sighed. “They rode with Lord Beric, to behead Ser Gregor Clegane.” She turned to
Septa Mordane, who was eating porridge with a wooden spoon. “Septa, will Lord Beric
spike Ser Gregor’s head on his own gate or bring it back here for the king?” She and
Jeyne Poole had been arguing over that last night.
The septa was horror-struck. “A lady does not discuss such things over her porridge.
Where are your courtesies, Sansa? I swear, of late you’ve been near as bad as your sister.”
“What did Gregor do?” Arya asked.
“He burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people, women and children too.”
Arya screwed up her face in a scowl. “Jaime Lannister murdered Jory and Heward and
Wyl, and the Hound murdered Mycah. Somebody should have beheaded them.”
“It’s not the same,” Sansa said. “The Hound is Joffrey’s sworn shield. Your butcher’s boy
attacked the prince.”
“Liar,” Arya said. Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed
between her fingers.
“Go ahead, call me all the names you want,” Sansa said airily. “You won’t dare when I’m
married to Joffrey. You’ll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace.” She shrieked as
Arya flung the orange across the table. It caught her in the middle of the forehead with a
wet squish and plopped down into her lap.
“You have juice on your face, Your Grace,” Arya said.
It was running down her nose and stinging her eyes. Sansa wiped it away with a napkin.
When she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress, she
shrieked again. “You’re horrible,” she screamed at her sister. “They should have killed
you instead of Lady!”
Septa Mordane came lurching to her feet. “Your lord father will hear of this! Go to your
chambers, at once. At once!”

“Me too?” Tears welled in Sansa’s eyes. “That’s not fair.”
“The matter is not subject to discussion. Go!”
Sansa stalked away with her head up. She was to be a queen, and queens did not cry. At
least not where people could see. When she reached her bedchamber, she barred the
door and took off her dress. The blood orange had left a blotchy red stain on the silk. “I
hate her!” she screamed. She balled up the dress and flung it into the cold hearth, on top
of the ashes of last night’s fire. When she saw that the stain had bled through onto her
underskirt, she began to sob despite herself. She ripped off the rest of her clothes wildly,
threw herself into bed, and cried herself back to sleep.
It was midday when Septa Mordane knocked upon her door. “Sansa. Your lord father
will see you now.”
Sansa sat up. “Lady,” she whispered. For a moment it was as if the direwolf was there in
the room, looking at her with those golden eyes, sad and knowing. She had been
dreaming, she realized. Lady was with her, and they were running together,
and . . . and . . . trying to remember was like trying to catch the rain with her fingers. The
dream faded, and Lady was dead again.
“Sansa.” The rap came again, sharply. “Do you hear me?”
“Yes, Septa,” she called out. “Might I have a moment to dress, please?” Her eyes were red
from crying, but she did her best to make herself beautiful.
Lord Eddard was bent over a huge leather-bound book when Septa Mordane marched
her into the solar, his plaster-wrapped leg stiff beneath the table. “Come here, Sansa,” he
said, not unkindly, when the septa had gone for her sister. “Sit beside me.” He closed the
book.
Septa Mordane returned with Arya squirming in her grasp. Sansa had put on a lovely
pale green damask gown and a look of remorse, but her sister was still wearing the ratty
leathers and roughspun she’d worn at breakfast. “Here is the other one,” the septa
announced.
“My thanks, Septa Mordane. I would talk to my daughters alone, if you would be so
kind.” The septa bowed and left.
“Arya started it,” Sansa said quickly, anxious to have the first word. “She called me a liar
and threw an orange at me and spoiled my dress, the ivory silk, the one Queen Cersei

gave me when I was betrothed to Prince Joffrey. She hates that I’m going to marry the
prince. She tries to spoil everything, Father, she can’t stand for anything to be beautiful
or nice or splendid.”
“Enough, Sansa.” Lord Eddard’s voice was sharp with impatience.
Arya raised her eyes. “I’m sorry, Father. I was wrong and I beg my sweet sister’s
forgiveness.”
Sansa was so startled that for a moment she was speechless. Finally she found her voice.
“What about my dress?”
“Maybe . . . I could wash it,” Arya said doubtfully.
“Washing won’t do any good,” Sansa said. “Not if you scrubbed all day and all night. The
silk is ruined.”
“Then I’ll . . . make you a new one,” Arya said.
Sansa threw back her head in disdain. “You? You couldn’t sew a dress fit to clean the
pigsties.”
Their father sighed. “I did not call you here to talk of dresses. I’m sending you both back
to Winterfell.”
For the second time Sansa found herself too stunned for words. She felt her eyes grow
moist again.
“You can’t,” Arya said.
“Please, Father,” Sansa managed at last. “Please don’t.”
Eddard Stark favored his daughters with a tired smile. “At last we’ve found something
you agree on.”
“I didn’t do anything wrong,” Sansa pleaded with him. “I don’t want to go back.” She
loved Mng’s Landing; the pagaentry of the court, the high lords and ladies in their
velvets and silks and gemstones, the great city with all its people. The tournament had
been the most magical time of her whole life, and there was so much she had not seen
yet, harvest feasts and masked balls and mummer shows. She could not bear the thought
of losing it all. “Send Arya away, she started it, Father, I swear it. I’ll be good, you’ll see,

just let me stay and I promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as the queen.”
Father’s mouth twitched strangely. “Sansa, I’m not sending you away for fighting,
though the gods know I’m sick of you two squabbling. I want you back in Winterfell for
your own safety. Three of my men were cut down like dogs not a league from where we
sit, and what does Robert do? He goes hunting.”
Arya was chewing at her lip in that disgusting way she had. “Can we take Syrio back with
us?”
“Who cares about your stupid dancing master?” Sansa flared. “Father, I only just now
remembered, I can’t go away, I’m to marry Prince Joffrey.” She tried to smile bravely for
him. “I love him, Father, I truly truly do, I love him as much as Queen Naerys loved
Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, as much as Jonquil loved Ser Florian. I want to be his
queen and have his babies.”
“Sweet one,” her father said gently, “listen to me. When you’re old enough, I will make
you a match with a high lord who’s worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong.
This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake. That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must
believe me.”
“He is!” Sansa insisted. “I don’t want someone brave and gentle, I want him. We’ll be
ever so happy, just like in the songs, you’ll see. I’ll give him a son with golden hair, and
one day he’ll be the king of all the realm, the greatest king that ever was, as brave as the
wolf and as proud as the lion.”
Arya made a face. “Not if Joffrey’s his father,” she said. “He’s a liar and a craven and
anyhow he’s a stag, not a lion.”
Sansa felt tears in her eyes. “He is not! He’s not the least bit like that old drunken king,”
she screamed at her sister, forgetting herself in her grief.
Father looked at her strangely. “Gods,” he swore softly, “out of the mouth of babes . . . ”
He shouted for Septa Mordane. To the girls he said, “I am looking for a fast trading
galley to take you home. These days, the sea is safer than the kingsroad. You will sail as
soon as I can find a proper ship, with Septa Mordane and a complement of
guards . . . and yes, with Syrio Forel, if he agrees to enter my service. But say nothing of
this. It’s better if no one knows of our plans. We’ll talk again tomorrow.”
Sansa cried as Septa Mordane marched them down the steps. They were going to take it
all away; the tournaments and the court and her prince, everything, they were going to
send her back to the bleak grey walls of Winterfell and lock her up forever. Her life was

over before it had begun.
“Stop that weeping, child,” Septa Mordane said sternly. “I am certain your lord father
knows what is best for you.”
“It won’t be so bad, Sansa,” Arya said. “We’re going to sail on a galley. It will be an
adventure, and then we’ll be with Bran and Robb again, and Old Nan and Hodor and the
rest.” She touched her on the arm.
“Hodor!” Sansa yelled. “You ought to marry Hodor, you’re just like him, stupid and hairy
and ugly!” She wrenched away from her sister’s hand, stormed into her bedchamber,
and barred the door behind her.

EDDARD
Pain is a gift from the gods, Lord Eddard,” Grand Maester Pycelle told him. “It means
the bone is knitting, the flesh healing itself. Be thankful.”
“I will be thankful when my leg stops throbbing.”
Pycelle set a stoppered flask on the table by the bed. “The milk of the poppy, for when
the pain grows too onerous.”
“I sleep too much already.”
“Sleep is the great healer.”
“I had hoped that was you.”
Pycelle smiled wanly. “It is good to see you in such a fierce humor, my lord.” He leaned
close and lowered his voice. “There was a raven this morning, a letter for the queen from
her lord father. I thought you had best know.”
“Dark wings, dark words,” Ned said grimly. “What of it?”
“Lord Tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after Ser Gregor Clegane,” the
maester confided. “I feared he would be. You will recall, I said as much in council.”
“Let him be wroth,” Ned said. Every time his leg throbbed, he remembered Jaime
Lannister’s smile, and Jory dead in his arms. “Let him write all the letters to the queen
he likes. Lord Beric rides beneath the king’s own banner. If Lord Tywin attempts to
interfere with the king’s justice, he will have Robert to answer to. The only thing His
Grace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy him.”
Pycelle pulled back, his maester’s chain jangling. “As you say. I shall visit again on the
morrow.” The old man hurriedly gathered up his things and took his leave. Ned had little
doubt that he was bound straight for the royal apartments, to whisper at the queen. I
thought you had best know, indeed . . . as if Cersei had not instructed him to pass along
her father’s threats. He hoped his response rattled those perfect teeth of hers. Ned was
not near as confident of Robert as he pretended, but there was no reason Cersei need

know that.
When Pycelle was gone, Ned called for a cup of honeyed wine. That clouded the mind as
well, yet not as badly. He needed to be able to think. A thousand times, he asked himself
what Jon Arryn might have done, had he lived long enough to act on what he’d learned.
Or perhaps he had acted, and died for it.
It was queer how sometimes a child’s innocent eyes can see things that grown men are
blind to. Someday, when Sansa was grown, he would have to tell her how she had made
it all come clear for him. He’s not the least bit like that old drunken king, she had
declared, angry and unknowing, and the simple truth of it had twisted inside him, cold
as death. This was the sword that killed Jon Arryn, Ned thought then, and it will kill
Robert as well, a slower death but full as certain. Shattered legs may heal in time, but
some betrayals fester and poison the soul.
Littlefinger came calling an hour after the Grand Maester had left, clad in a plumcolored doublet with a mockingbird embroidered on the breast in black thread, and a
striped cloak of black and white. “I cannot visit long, my lord,” he announced. “Lady
Tanda expects me to lunch with her. No doubt she will roast me a fatted calf. If it’s near
as fatted as her daughter, I’m like to rupture and die. And how is your leg?”
“Inflamed and painful, with an itch that is driving me mad.”
Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow. “In future, try not to let any horses fall on it. I would urge
you to heal quickly. The realm grows restive. Varys has heard ominous whispers from
the west. Freeriders and sellswords have been flocking to Casterly Rock, and not for the
thin pleasure of Lord Tywin’s conversation.”
“Is there word of the king?” Ned demanded. “Just how long does Robert intend to hunt?”
“Given his preferences, I believe he’d stay in the forest until you and the queen both die
of old age,” Lord Petyr replied with a faint smile. “Lacking that, I imagine he’ll return as
soon as he’s killed something. They found the white hart, it seems . . . or rather, what
remained of it. Some wolves found it first, and left His Grace scarcely more than a hoof
and a horn. Robert was in a fury, until he heard talk of some monstrous boar deeper in
the forest. Then nothing would do but he must have it. Prince Joffrey returned this
morning, with the Royces, Ser Balon Swann, and some twenty others of the party. The
rest are still with the king.”
“The Hound?” Ned asked, frowning. Of all the Lannister party, Sandor Clegane was the
one who concerned him the most, now that Ser Jaime had fled the city to join his father.

“Oh, returned with Joffrey, and went straight to the queen.” Littlefinger smiled. “I would
have given a hundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned
that Lord Beric was off to behead his brother.”
“Even a blind man could see the Hound loathed his brother.”
“Ah, but Gregor was his to loathe, not yours to kill. Once Dondarrion lops the summit off
our Mountain, the Clegane lands and incomes will pass to Sandor, but I wouldn’t hold
my water waiting for his thanks, not that one. And now you must forgive me. Lady
Tanda awaits with her fatted calves.”
On the way to the door, Lord Petyr spied Grand Maester Malleon’s massive tome on the
table and paused to idly flip open the cover. “The Lineages and Histories of the Great
Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble
Ladies and Their Children,“ he read. “Now there is tedious reading if ever I saw it. A
sleeping potion, my lord?”
For a brief moment Ned considered telling him all of it, but there was something in
Littlefinger’s japes that irked him. The man was too clever by half, a mocking smile
never far from his lips. “Jon Arryn was studying this volume when he was taken sick,”
Ned said in a careful tone, to see how he might respond.
And he responded as he always did: with a quip. “In that case,” he said, “death must
have come as a blessed relief.” Lord Petyr Baelish bowed and took his leave.
Eddard Stark allowed himself a curse. Aside from his own retainers, there was scarcely a
man in this city he trusted. Littlefinger had concealed Catelyn and helped Ned in his
inquiries, yet his haste to save his own skin when Jaime and his swords had come out of
the rain still rankled. Varys was worse. For all his protestations of loyalty, the eunuch
knew too much and did too little. Grand Maester Pycelle seemed more Cersei’s creature
with every passing day, and Ser Barristan was an old man, and rigid. He would tell Ned
to do his duty.
Time was perilously short. The king would return from his hunt soon, and honor would
require Ned to go to him with all he had learned. Vayon Poole had arranged for Sansa
and Arya to sail on the Wind Witch out of Braavos, three days hence. They would be
back at Winterfell before the harvest. Ned could no longer use his concern for their
safety to excuse his delay.
Yet last night he had dreamt of Rhaegar’s children. Lord Tywin had laid the bodies
beneath the Iron Throne, wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard. That was
clever of him; the blood did not show so badly against the red cloth. The little princess

had been barefoot, still dressed in her bed gown, and the boy . . . the boy . . .
Ned could not let that happen again. The realm could not withstand a second mad king,
another dance of blood and vengeance. He must find some way to save the children.
Robert could be merciful. Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man he had pardoned.
Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys the Spider, Lord Balon Greyjoy; each had been counted an
enemy to Robert once, and each had been welcomed into friendship and allowed to
retain honors and office for a pledge of fealty. So long as a man was brave and honest,
Robert would treat him with all the honor and respect due a valiant enemy.
This was something else: poison in the dark, a knife thrust to the soul. This he could
never forgive, no more than he had forgiven Rhaegar. He will kill them all, Ned realized.
And yet, he knew he could not keep silent. He had a duty to Robert, to the realm, to the
shade of Jon Arryn . . . and to Bran, who surely must have stumbled on some part of the
truth. Why else would they have tried to slay him?
Late that afternoon he summoned Tomard, the portly guardsman with the gingercolored whiskers his children called Fat Tom. With Jory dead and Alyn gone, Fat Tom
had command of his household guard. The thought filled Ned with vague disquiet.
Tomard was a solid man; affable, loyal, tireless, capable in a limited way, but he was
near fifty, and even in his youth he had never been energetic. Perhaps Ned should not
have been so quick to send off half his guard, and all his best swords among them.
“I shall require your help,” Ned said when Tomard appeared, looking faintly
apprehensive, as he always did when called before his lord. “Take me to the godswood.”
“Is that wise, Lord Eddard? With your leg and all?”
“Perhaps not. But necessary.”
Tomard summoned Varly. With one arm around each man’s shoulders, Ned managed to
descend the steep tower steps and hobble across the bailey. “I want the guard doubled,”
he told Fat Tom. “No one enters or leaves the Tower of the Hand without my leave.”
Tom blinked. “M’lord, with Alyn and the others away, we are hard-pressed already—”
“It will only be a short while. Lengthen the watches.”
“As you say, m’lord,” Tom answered. “Might I ask why—”

“Best not,” Ned answered crisply.
The godswood was empty, as it always was here in this citadel of the southron gods.
Ned’s leg was screaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart tree. “Thank
you.” He drew a paper from his sleeve, sealed with the sigil of his House. “Kindly deliver
this at once.”
Tomard looked at the name Ned had written on the paper and licked his lips anxiously.
“My lord . . . ”
“Do as I bid you, Tom,” Ned said.
How long he waited in the quiet of the godswood, he could not say. It was peaceful here.
The thick walls shut out the clamor of the castle, and he could hear birds singing, the
murmur of crickets, leaves rustling in a gentle wind. The heart tree was an oak, brown
and faceless, yet Ned Stark still felt the presence of his gods. His leg did not seem to hurt
so much.
She came to him at sunset, as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers. She came
alone, as he had bid her. For once she was dressed simply, in leather boots and hunting
greens. When she drew back the hood of her brown cloak, he saw the bruise where the
king had struck her. The angry plum color had faded to yellow, and the swelling was
down, but there was no mistaking it for anything but what it was.
“Why here?” Cersei Lannister asked as she stood over him.
“So the gods can see.”
She sat beside him on the grass. Her every move was graceful. Her curling blond hair
moved in the wind, and her eyes were green as the leaves of summer. It had been a long
time since Ned Stark had seen her beauty, but he saw it now. “I know the truth Jon
Arryn died for,” he told her.
“Do you?” The queen watched his face, wary as a cat. “Is that why you called me here,
Lord Stark? To pose me riddles? Or is it your intent to seize me, as your wife seized my
brother?”
“If you truly believed that, you would never have come.” Ned touched her cheek gently.
“Has he done this before?”
“Once or twice.” She shied away from his hand. “Never on the face before. Jaime would

have killed him, even if it meant his own life.” Cersei looked at him defiantly. “My
brother is worth a hundred of your friend.”
“Your brother?” Ned said. “Or your lover?”
“Both.” She did not flinch from the truth. “Since we were children together. And why
not? The Targaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years, to keep the
bloodlines pure. And Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We are one person in
two bodies. We shared a womb together. He came into this world holding my foot, our
old maester said. When he is in me, I feel . . . whole.” The ghost of a smile flitted over her
lips.
“My son Bran . . . ”
To her credit, Cersei did not look away. “He saw us. You love your children, do you not?”
Robert had asked him the very same question, the morning of the melee. He gave her the
same answer. “With all my heart.”
“No less do I love mine.”
Ned thought, If it came to that, the life of some child I did not know, against Robb and
Sansa and Arya and Bran and Rickon, what would I do? Even more so, what would
Catelyn do, if it were Jon’s life, against the children of her body? He did not know. He
prayed he never would.
“All three are Jaime’s,” he said. It was not a question.
“Thank the gods.”
The seed is strong, Jon Arryn had cried on his deathbed, and so it was. All those
bastards, all with hair as black as night. Grand Maester Malleon recorded the last mating
between stag and lion, some ninety years ago, when Tya Lannister wed Gowen
Baratheon, third son of the reigning lord. Their only issue, an unnamed boy described in
Malleon’s tome as a large and lusty lad born with a full head of black hair, died in
infancy. Thirty years before that a male Lannister had taken a Baratheon maid to wife.
She had given him three daughters and a son, each black-haired. No matter how far back
Ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages, always he found the gold yielding before the
coal.
“A dozen years,” Ned said. “How is it that you have had no children by the king?”

She lifted her head, defiant. “Your Robert got me with child once,” she said, her voice
thick with contempt. “My brother found a woman to cleanse me. He never knew. If truth
be told, I can scarcely bear for him to touch me, and I have not let him inside me for
years. I know other ways to pleasure him, when he leaves his whores long enough to
stagger up to my bedchamber. Whatever we do, the king is usually so drunk that he’s
forgotten it all by the next morning.”
How could they have all been so blind? The truth was there in front of them all the time,
written on the children’s faces. Ned felt sick. “I remember Robert as he was the day he
took the throne, every inch a king,” he said quietly. “A thousand other women might
have loved him with all their hearts. What did he do to make you hate him so?”
Her eyes burned, green fire in the dusk, like the lioness that was her sigil. “The night of
our wedding feast, the first time we shared a bed, he called me by your sister’s name. He
was on top of me, in me, stinking of wine, and he whispered Lyanna.”
Ned Stark thought of pale blue roses, and for a moment he wanted to weep. “I do not
know which of you I pity most.”
The queen seemed amused by that. “Save your pity for yourself, Lord Stark. I want none
of it.”
“You know what I must do.”
“Must?” She put her hand on his good leg, just above the knee. “A true man does what he
will, not what he must.” Her fingers brushed lightly against his thigh, the gentlest of
promises. “The realm needs a strong Hand. Joff will not come of age for years. No one
wants war again, least of all me.” Her hand touched his face, his hair. “If friends can turn
to enemies, enemies can become friends. Your wife is a thousand leagues away, and my
brother has fled. Be kind to me, Ned. I swear to you, you shall never regret it.”
“Did you make the same offer to Jon Arryn?”
She slapped him.
“I shall wear that as a badge of honor,” Ned said dryly.
“Honor,” she spat. “How dare you play the noble lord with me! What do you take me
for? You’ve a bastard of your own, I’ve seen him. Who was the mother, I wonder? Some
Dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned? A whore? Or was it the grieving
sister, the Lady Ashara? She threw herself into the sea, I’m told. Why was that? For the
brother you slew, or the child you stole? Tell me, my honorable Lord Eddard, how are

you any different from Robert, or me, or Jaime?”
“For a start,” said Ned, “I do not kill children. You would do well to listen, my lady. I
shall say this only once. When the king returns from his hunt, I intend to lay the truth
before him. You must be gone by then. You and your children, all three, and not to
Casterly Rock. If I were you, I should take ship for the Free Cities, or even farther, to the
Summer Isles or the Port of Ibben. As far as the winds blow.”
“Exile,” she said. “A bitter cup to drink from.”
“A sweeter cup than your father served Rhaegar’s children,” Ned said, “and kinder than
you deserve. Your father and your brothers would do well to go with you. Lord Tywin’s
gold will buy you comfort and hire swords to keep you safe. You shall need them. I
promise you, no matter where you flee, Robert’s wrath will follow you, to the back of
beyond if need be.”
The queen stood. “And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?” she asked softly. Her eyes
searched his face. “You should have taken the realm for yourself. It was there for the
taking. Jaime told me how you found him on the Iron Throne the day King’s Landing
fell, and made him yield it up. That was your moment. All you needed to do was climb
those steps, and sit. Such a sad mistake.”
“I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine,” Ned said, “but that was not
one of them.”
“Oh, but it was, my lord,” Cersei insisted. “When you play the game of thrones, you win
or you die. There is no middle ground.”
She turned up her hood to hide her swollen face and left him there in the dark beneath
the oak, amidst the quiet of the godswood, under a blue-black sky. The stars were
coming out.

DAENERYS
The heart was steaming in the cool evening air when Khal Drogo set it before her, raw
and bloody. His arms were red to the elbow. Behind him, his bloodriders knelt on the
sand beside the corpse of the wild stallion, stone knives in their hands. The stallion’s
blood looked black in the flickering orange glare of the torches that ringed the high chalk
walls of the pit.
Dany touched the soft swell of her belly. Sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her
brow. She could feel the old women watching her, the ancient crones of Vaes Dothrak,
with eyes that shone dark as polished flint in their wrinkled faces. She must not flinch or
look afraid. I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself as she took the stallion’s heart
in both hands, lifted it to her mouth, and plunged her teeth into the tough, stringy flesh.
Warm blood filled her mouth and ran down over her chin. The taste threatened to gag
her, but she made herself chew and swallow. The heart of a stallion would make her son
strong and swift and fearless, or so the Dothraki believed, but only if the mother could
eat it all. If she choked on the blood or retched up the flesh, the omens were less
favorable; the child might be stillborn, or come forth weak, deformed, or female.
Her handmaids had helped her ready herself for the ceremony. Despite the tender
mother’s stomach that had afflicted her these past two moons, Dany had dined on bowls
of half-clotted blood to accustom herself to the taste, and Irri made her chew strips of
dried horseflesh until her jaws were aching. She had starved herself for a day and a night
before the ceremony in the hopes that hunger would help her keep down the raw meat.
The wild stallion’s heart was all muscle, and Dany had to worry it with her teeth and
chew each mouthful a long time. No steel was permitted within the sacred confines of
Vaes Dothrak, beneath the shadow of the Mother of Mountains; she had to rip the heart
apart with teeth and nails. Her stomach roiled and heaved, yet she kept on, her face
smeared with the heartsblood that sometimes seemed to explode against her lips.
Khal Drogo stood over her as she ate, his face as hard as a bronze shield. His long black
braid was shiny with oil. He wore gold rings in his mustache, gold bells in his braid, and
a heavy belt of solid gold medallions around his waist, but his chest was bare. She looked
at him whenever she felt her strength failing; looked at him, and chewed and swallowed,
chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed. Toward the end, Dany thought she

glimpsed a fierce pride in his dark, almond-shaped eyes, but she could not be sure. The
khal’s face did not often betray the thoughts within.
And finally it was done. Her cheeks and fingers were sticky as she forced down the last of
it. Only then did she turn her eyes back to the old women, the crones of the dosh khaleen.
“Khalakka dothrae mr’anha!” she proclaimed in her best Dothraki. A prince rides inside
me! She had practiced the phrase for days with her handmaid Jhiqui.
The oldest of the crones, a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single black eye,
raised her arms on high. “Khalakka dothrae!” she shrieked. The prince is riding!
“He is riding!” the other women answered. “Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!” they proclaimed. A
boy, a boy, a strong boy.
Bells rang, a sudden clangor of bronze birds. A deep-throated warhorn sounded its long
low note. The old women began to chant. Underneath their painted leather vests, their
withered dugs swayed back and forth, shiny with oil and sweat. The eunuchs who served
them threw bundles of dried grasses into a great bronze brazier, and clouds of fragrant
smoke rose up toward the moon and the stars. The Dothraki believed the stars were
horses made of fire, a great herd that galloped across the sky by night.
As the smoke ascended, the chanting died away and the ancient crone closed her single
eye, the better to peer into the future. The silence that fell was complete. Dany could
hear the distant call of night birds, the hiss and crackle of the torches, the gentle lapping
of water from the lake. The Dothraki stared at her with eyes of night, waiting.
Khal Drogo laid his hand on Dany’s arm. She could feel the tension in his fingers. Even a
khal as mighty as Drogo could know fear when the dosh khaleen peered into smoke of
the future. At her back, her handmaids fluttered anxiously.
Finally the crone opened her eye and lifted her arms. “I have seen his face, and heard the
thunder of his hooves,” she proclaimed in a thin, wavery voice.
“The thunder of his hooves!” the others chorused.
“As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men
without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as
a storm this prince will be. His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will
weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his
coming, and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name.” The old woman
trembled and looked at Dany almost as if she were afraid. “The prince is riding, and he

shall be the stallion who mounts the world.”
“The stallion who mounts the world!” the onlookers cried in echo, until the night rang to
the sound of their voices.
The one-eyed crone peered at Dany. “What shall he be called, the stallion who mounts
the world?”
She stood to answer. “He shall be called Rhaego,” she said, using the words that Jhiqui
had taught her. Her hands touched the swell beneath her breasts protectively as a roar
went up from the Dothraki. “Rhaego,” they screamed. “Rhaego, Rhaego, Rhaego!”
The name was still ringing in her ears as Khal Drogo led her from the pit. His
bloodriders fell in behind them. A procession followed them out onto the godsway, the
broad grassy road that ran through the heart of Vaes Dothrak, from the horse gate to the
Mother of Mountains. The crones of the dosh khaleen came first, with their eunuchs and
slaves. Some supported themselves with tall carved staffs as they struggled along on
ancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any horselord. Each of the old
women had been a khaleesi once. When their lord husbands died and a new khal took
his place at the front of his riders, with a new khaleesi mounted beside him, they were
sent here, to reign over the vast Dothraki nation. Even the mightiest of khals bowed to
the wisdom and authority of the dosh khaleen. Still, it gave Dany the shivers to think
that one day she might be sent to join them, whether she willed it or no.
Behind the wise women came the others; Khal Ogo and his son, the khalakka Fogo, Khal
Jommo and his wives, the chief men of Drogo’s khalasar, Dany’s handmaids, the khal’s
servants and slaves, and more. Bells rang and drums beat a stately cadence as they
marched along the godsway. Stolen heroes and the gods of dead peoples brooded in the
darkness beyond the road. Alongside the procession, slaves ran lightly through the grass
with torches in their hands, and the flickering flames made the great monuments seem
almost alive.
“What is meaning, name Rhaego?” Khal Drogo asked as they walked, using the Common
Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She had been teaching him a few words when she could.
Drogo was quick to learn when he put his mind to it, though his accent was so thick and
barbarous that neither Ser Jorah nor Viserys could understand a word he said.
“My brother Rhaegar was a fierce warrior, my sun-and-stars,” she told him. “He died
before I was born. Ser Jorah says that he was the last of the dragons.”
Khal Drogo looked down at her. His face was a copper mask, yet under the long black
mustache, drooping beneath the weight of its gold rings, she thought she glimpsed the

shadow of a smile. “Is good name, Dan Ares wife, moon of my life,” he said.
They rode to the lake the Dothraki called the Womb of the World, surrounded by a
fringe of reeds, its water still and calm. A thousand thousand years ago, Jhiqui told her,
the first man had emerged from its depths, riding upon the back of the first horse.
The procession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled clothing
fall to the ground. Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no
bottom, but Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she pushed through the
tall reeds. The moon floated on the still black waters, shattering and re-forming as her
ripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness crept up her
thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion’s blood had dried on her hands and around
her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over her head,
cleansing herself and the child inside her while the khal and the others looked on. She
heard the old women of the dosh khaleen muttering to each other as they watched, and
wondered what they were saying.
When she emerged from the lake, shivering and dripping, her handmaid Doreah hurried
to her with a robe of painted sandsilk, but Khal Drogo waved her away. He was looking
on her swollen breasts and the curve of her belly with approval, and Dany could see the
shape of his manhood pressing through his horsehide trousers, below the heavy gold
medallions of his belt. She went to him and helped him unlace. Then her huge khal took
her by the hips and lifted her into the air, as he might lift a child. The bells in his hair
rang softly.
Dany wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed her face against his neck as
he thrust himself inside her. Three quick strokes and it was done. “The stallion who
mounts the world,” Drogo whispered hoarsely. His hands still smelled of horse blood.
He bit at her throat, hard, in the moment of his pleasure, and when he lifted her off, his
seed filled her and trickled down the inside of her thighs. Only then was Doreah
permitted to drape her in the scented sandsilk, and Irri to fit soft slippers to her feet.
Khal Drogo laced himself up and spoke a command, and horses were brought to the
lakeshore. Cohollo had the honor of helping the khaleesi onto her silver. Drogo spurred
his stallion, and set off down the godsway beneath the moon and stars. On her silver,
Dany easily kept pace.
The silk tenting that roofed Khal Drogo’s hall had been rolled up tonight, and the moon
followed them inside. Flames leapt ten feet in the air from three huge stone-lined
firepits. The air was thick with the smells of roasting meat and curdled, fermented
mare’s milk. The hall was crowded and noisy when they entered, the cushions packed
with those whose rank and name were not sufficient to allow them at the ceremony. As

Dany rode beneath the arched entry and up the center aisle, every eye was on her. The
Dothraki screamed out comments on her belly and her breasts, hailing the life within
her. She could not understand all they shouted, but one phrase came clear. “The stallion
that mounts the world,” she heard, bellowed in a thousand voices.
The sounds of drums and horns swirled up into the night. Half-clothed women spun and
danced on the low tables, amid joints of meat and platters piled high with plums and
dates and pomegranates. Many of the men were drunk on clotted mare’s milk, yet Dany
knew no arakhs would clash tonight, not here in the sacred city, where blades and
bloodshed were forbidden.
Khal Drogo dismounted and took his place on the high bench. Khal Jommo and Khal
Ogo, who had been in Vaes Dothrak with their khalasars when they arrived, were given
seats of high honor to Drogo’s right and left. The bloodriders of the three khals sat below
them, and farther down Khal Jommo’s four wives.
Dany climbed off her silver and gave the reins to one of the slaves. As Doreah and Irri
arranged her cushions, she searched for her brother. Even across the length of the
crowded hall, Viserys should have been conspicuous with his pale skin, silvery hair, and
beggar’s rags, but she did not see him anywhere.
Her glance roamed the crowded tables near the walls, where men whose braids were
even shorter than their manhoods sat on frayed rugs and flat cushions around the low
tables, but all the faces she saw had black eyes and copper skin. She spied Ser Jorah
Mormont near the center of the hall, close to the middle firepit. It was a place of respect,
if not high honor; the Dothraki esteemed the knight’s prowess with a sword. Dany sent
Jhiqui to bring him to her table. Mormont came at once, and went to one knee before
her. “Khaleesi,” he said, “I am yours to command.”
She patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside her. “Sit and talk with me.”
“You honor me.” The knight seated himself cross-legged on the cushion. A slave knelt
before him, offering a wooden platter full of ripe figs. Ser Jorah took one and bit it in
half.
“Where is my brother?” Dany asked. “He ought to have come by now, for the feast.”
“I saw His Grace this morning,” he told her. “He told me he was going to the Western
Market, in search of wine.”
“Wine?” Dany said doubtfully. Viserys could not abide the taste of the fermented mare’s
milk the Dothraki drank, she knew that, and he was oft at the bazaars these days,

drinking with the traders who came in the great caravans from east and west. He seemed
to find their company more congenial than hers.
“Wine,” Ser Jorah confirmed, “and he has some thought to recruit men for his army
from the sellswords who guard the caravans.” A serving girl laid a blood pie in front of
him, and he attacked it with both hands.
“Is that wise?” she asked. “He has no gold to pay soldiers. What if he’s betrayed?”
Caravan guards were seldom troubled much by thoughts of honor, and the Usurper in
King’s Landing would pay well for her brother’s head. “You ought to have gone with him,
to keep him safe. You are his sworn sword.”
“We are in Vaes Dothrak,” he reminded her. “No one may carry a blade here or shed a
man’s blood.”
“Yet men die,” she said. “Jhogo told me. Some of the traders have eunuchs with them,
huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk. That way no blood is shed and the
gods are not angered.”
“Then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything.” Ser Jorah
wiped the grease off his mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close over the table.
“He had planned to take your dragon’s eggs, until I warned him that I’d cut off his hand
if he so much as touched them.”
For a moment Dany was so shocked she had no words. “My eggs . . . but they’re mine,
Magister Illyrio gave them to me, a bride gift, why would Viserys want . . . they’re only
stones . . . ”
“The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals, Princess . . . and
dragon’s eggs are rarer by far. Those traders he’s been drinking with would sell their own
manhoods for even one of those stones, and with all three Viserys could buy as many
sellswords as he might need.”
Dany had not known, had not even suspected. “Then . . . he should have them. He does
not need to steal them. He had only to ask. He is my brother . . . and my true king.”
“He is your brother,” Ser Jorah acknowledged.
“You do not understand, ser,” she said. “My mother died giving me birth, and my father
and my brother Rhaegar even before that. I would never have known so much as their
names if Viserys had not been there to tell me. He was the only one left. The only one.
He is all I have.”

“Once,” said Ser Jorah. “No longer, Khaleesi. You belong to the Dothraki now. In your
womb rides the stallion who mounts the world.” He held out his cup, and a slave filled it
with fermented mare’s milk, sour-smelling and thick with clots.
Dany waved her away. Even the smell of it made her feel ill, and she would take no
chances of bringing up the horse heart she had forced herself to eat. “What does it
mean?” she asked. “What is this stallion? Everyone was shouting it at me, but I don’t
understand.”
“The stallion is the khal of khals promised in ancient prophecy, child. He will unite the
Dothraki into a single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth, or so it was promised.
All the people of the world will be his herd.”
“Oh,” Dany said in a small voice. Her hand smoothed her robe down over the swell of
her stomach. “I named him Rhaego.”
“A name to make the Usurper’s blood run cold.”
Suddenly Doreah was tugging at her elbow. “My lady, “ the handmaid whispered
urgently, “your brother . . . ”
Dany looked down the length of the long, roofless hall and there he was, striding toward
her. From the lurch in his step, she could tell at once that Viserys had found his
wine . . . and something that passed for courage.
He was wearing his scarlet silks, soiled and travel-stained. His cloak and gloves were
black velvet, faded from the sun. His boots were dry and cracked, his silver-blond hair
matted and tangled. A longsword swung from his belt in a leather scabbard. The
Dothraki eyed the sword as he passed; Dany heard curses and threats and angry
muttering rising all around her, like a tide. The music died away in a nervous
stammering of drums.
A sense of dread closed around her heart. “Go to him,” she commanded Ser Jorah. “Stop
him. Bring him here. Tell him he can have the dragon’s eggs if that is what he wants.”
The knight rose swiftly to his feet.
“Where is my sister?” Viserys shouted, his voice thick with wine. “I’ve come for her feast.
How dare you presume to eat without me? No one eats before the king. Where is she?
The whore can’t hide from the dragon.”
He stopped beside the largest of the three firepits, peering around at the faces of the

Dothraki. There were five thousand men in the hall, but only a handful who knew the
Common Tongue. Yet even if his words were incomprehensible, you had only to look at
him to know that he was drunk.
Ser Jorah went to him swiftly, whispered something in his ear, and took him by the arm,
but Viserys wrenched free. “Keep your hands off me! No one touches the dragon without
leave.”
Dany glanced anxiously up at the high bench. Khal Drogo was saying something to the
other khals beside him. Khal Jommo grinned, and Khal Ogo began to guffaw loudly.
The sound of laughter made Viserys lift his eyes. “Khal Drogo,” he said thickly, his voice
almost polite. “I’m here for the feast.” He staggered away from Ser Jorah, making to join
the three khals on the high bench.
Khal Drogo rose, spat out a dozen words in Dothraki, faster than Dany could
understand, and pointed. “Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench,” Ser
Jorah translated for her brother. “Khal Drogo says your place is there.”
Viserys glanced where the khal was pointing. At the back of the long hall, in a corner by
the wall, deep in shadow so better men would not need to look on them, sat the lowest of
the low; raw unblooded boys, old men with clouded eyes and stiff joints, the dim-witted
and the maimed. Far from the meat, and farther from honor. “That is no place for a
king,” her brother declared.
“Is place,” Khal Drogo answered, in the Common Tongue that Dany had taught him, “for
Sorefoot King.” He clapped his hands together. “A cart! Bring cart for Khal Rhaggat!”
Five thousand Dothraki began to laugh and shout. Ser Jorah was standing beside
Viserys, screaming in his ear, but the roar in the hall was so thunderous that Dany could
not hear what he was saying. Her brother shouted back and the two men grappled, until
Mormont knocked Viserys bodily to the floor.
Her brother drew his sword.
The bared steel shone a fearful red in the glare from the firepits. “Keep away from me!”
Viserys hissed. Ser Jorah backed off a step, and her brother climbed unsteadily to his
feet. He waved the sword over his head, the borrowed blade that Magister Illyrio had
given him to make him seem more kingly. Dothraki were shrieking at him from all sides,
screaming vile curses.
Dany gave a wordless cry of terror. She knew what a drawn sword meant here, even if

her brother did not.
Her voice made Viserys turn his head, and he saw her for the first time. “There she is,”
he said, smiling. He stalked toward her, slashing at the air as if to cut a path through a
wall of enemies, though no one tried to bar his way.
“The blade . . . you must not,” she begged him. “Please, Viserys. It is forbidden. Put down
the sword and come share my cushions. There’s drink, food . . . is it the dragon’s eggs
you want? You can have them, only throw away the sword.”
“Do as she tells you, fool,” Ser Jorah shouted, “before you get us all killed.”
Viserys laughed. “They can’t kill us. They can’t shed blood here in the sacred city . . . but
I can.” He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys’s breasts and slid it downward,
over the curve of her belly. “I want what I came for,” he told her. “I want the crown he
promised me. He bought you, but he never paid for you. Tell him I want what I
bargained for, or I’m taking you back. You and the eggs both. He can keep his bloody
foal. I’ll cut the bastard out and leave it for him.” The sword point pushed through her
silks and pricked at her navel. Viserys was weeping, she saw; weeping and laughing, both
at the same time, this man who had once been her brother.
Distantly, as from far away, Dany heard her handmaid Jhiqui sobbing in fear, pleading
that she dared not translate, that the khal would bind her and drag her behind his horse
all the way up the Mother of Mountains. She put her arm around the girl. “Don’t be
afraid,” she said. “I shall tell him.”
She did not know if she had enough words, yet when she was done Khal Drogo spoke a
few brusque sentences in Dothraki, and she knew he understood. The sun of her life
stepped down from the high bench. “What did he say?” the man who had been her
brother asked her, flinching.
It had grown so silent in the hall that she could hear the bells in Khal Drogo’s hair,
chiming softly with each step he took. His bloodriders followed him, like three copper
shadows. Daenerys had gone cold all over. “He says you shall have a splendid golden
crown that men shall tremble to behold.”
Viserys smiled and lowered his sword. That was the saddest thing, the thing that tore at
her afterward . . . the way he smiled. “That was all I wanted,” he said. “What was
promised.”
When the sun of her life reached her, Dany slid an arm around his waist. The khal said a
word, and his bloodriders leapt forward. Qotho seized the man who had been her

brother by the arms. Haggo shattered his wrist with a single, sharp twist of his huge
hands. Cohollo pulled the sword from his limp fingers. Even now Viserys did not
understand. “No,” he shouted, “you cannot touch me, I am the dragon, the dragon, and I
will be crowned!”
Khal Drogo unfastened his belt. The medallions were pure gold, massive and ornate,
each one as large as a man’s hand. He shouted a command. Cook slaves pulled a heavy
iron stew pot from the firepit, dumped the stew onto the ground, and returned the pot to
the flames. Drogo tossed in the belt and watched without expression as the medallions
turned red and began to lose their shape. She could see fires dancing in the onyx of his
eyes. A slave handed him a pair of thick horsehair mittens, and he pulled them on, never
so much as looking at the man.
Viserys began to scream the high, wordless scream of the coward facing death. He kicked
and twisted, whimpered like a dog and wept like a child, but the Dothraki held him tight
between them. Ser Jorah had made his way to Dany’s side. He put a hand on her
shoulder. “Turn away, my princess, I beg you.”
“No.” She folded her arms across the swell of her belly, protectively.
At the last, Viserys looked at her. “Sister, please . . . Dany, tell them . . . make
them . . . sweet sister . . . ”
When the gold was half-melted and starting to run, Drogo reached into the flames,
snatched out the pot. “Crown!” he roared. “Here. A crown for Cart King!” And upended
the pot over the head of the man who had been her brother.
The sound Viserys Targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered his face was
like nothing human. His feet hammered a frantic beat against the dirt floor, slowed,
stopped. Thick globs of molten gold dripped down onto his chest, setting the scarlet silk
to smoldering . . . yet no drop of blood was spilled.
He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon.

EDDARD
He was walking through the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he he had walked a thousand
times before. The Kings of Winter watched him pass with eyes of ice, and the direwolves
at their feet turned their great stone heads and snarled. Last of all, he came to the tomb
where his father slept, with Brandon and Lyanna beside him. “Promise me, Ned,”
Lyanna’s statue whispered. She wore a garland of pale blue roses, and her eyes wept
blood.
Eddard Stark jerked upright, his heart racing, the blankets tangled around him. The
room was black as pitch, and someone was hammering on the door. “Lord Eddard,” a
voice called loudly.
“A moment.” Groggy and naked, he stumbled his way across the darkened chamber.
When he opened the door, he found Tomard with an upraised fist, and Cayn with a taper
in hand. Between them stood the king’s own steward.
The man’s face might have been carved of stone, so little did it show. “My lord Hand,” he
intoned. “His Grace the King commands your presence. At once.”
So Robert had returned from his hunt. It was long past time. “I shall need a few
moments to dress.” Ned left the man waiting without. Cayn helped him with his clothes;
white linen tunic and grey cloak, trousers cut open down his plaster-sheathed leg, his
badge of office, and last of all a belt of heavy silver links. He sheathed the Valyrian
dagger at his waist.
The Red Keep was dark and still as Cayn and Tomard escorted him across the inner
bailey. The moon hung low over the walls, ripening toward full. On the ramparts, a
guardsman in a gold cloak walked his rounds.
The royal apartments were in Maegor’s Holdfast, a massive square fortress that nestled
in the heart of the Red Keep behind walls twelve feet thick and a dry moat lined with
iron spikes, a castle-within-a-castle. Ser Boros Blount guarded the far end of the bridge,
white steel armor ghostly in the moonlight. Within, Ned passed two other knights of the
Kingsguard; Ser Preston Greenfield stood at the bottom of the steps, and Ser Barristan
Selmy waited at the door of the king’s bedchamber. Three men in white cloaks, he
thought, remembering, and a strange chill went through him. Ser Barristan’s face was as

pale as his armor. Ned had only to look at him to know that something was dreadfully
wrong. The royal steward opened the door. “Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King,”
he announced.
“Bring him here,” Robert’s voice called, strangely thick.
Fires blazed in the twin hearths at either end of the bedchamber, filling the room with a
sullen red glare. The heat within was suffocating. Robert lay across the canopied bed. At
the bedside hovered Grand Maester Pycelle, while Lord Renly paced restlessly before the
shuttered windows. Servants moved back and forth, feeding logs to the fire and boiling
wine. Cersei Lannister sat on the edge of the bed beside her husband. Her hair was
tousled, as if from sleep, but there was nothing sleepy in her eyes. They followed Ned as
Tomard and Cayn helped him cross the room. He seemed to move very slowly, as if he
were still dreaming.
The king still wore his boots. Ned could see dried mud and blades of grass clinging to the
leather where Robert’s feet stuck out beneath the blanket that covered him, A green
doublet lay on the floor, slashed open and discarded, the cloth crusted with red-brown
stains. The room smelled of smoke and blood and death.
“Ned,” the king whispered when he saw him. His face was pale as milk.
“Come . . . closer.”
His men brought him close. Ned steadied himself with a hand on the bedpost. He had
only to look down at Robert to know how bad it was. “What . . . ?” he began, his throat
clenched.
“A boar.” Lord Renly was still in his hunting greens, his cloak spattered with blood.
“A devil,” the king husked. “My own fault. Too much wine, damn me to hell. Missed my
thrust.”
“And where were the rest of you?” Ned demanded of Lord Renly. “Where was Ser
Barristan and the Kingsguard?”
Renly’s mouth twitched. “My brother commanded us to stand aside and let him take the
boar alone.”
Eddard Stark lifted the blanket.
They had done what they could to close him up, but it was nowhere near enough. The
boar must have been a fearsome thing. It had ripped the king from groin to nipple with

its tusks. The wine-soaked bandages that Grand Maester Pycelle had applied were
already black with blood, and the smell off the wound was hideous. Ned’s stomach
turned. He let the blanket fall.
“Stinks,” Robert said. “The stink of death, don’t think I can’t smell it. Bastard did me
good, eh? But I . . . I paid him back in kind, Ned.” The king’s smile was as terrible as his
wound, his teeth red. “Drove a knife right through his eye. Ask them if I didn’t. Ask
them.”
“Truly,” Lord Renly murmured. “We brought the carcass back with us, at my brother’s
command.”
“For the feast,” Robert whispered. “Now leave us. The lot of you. I need to speak with
Ned.”
“Robert, my sweet lord . . . ” Cersei began.
“I said leave,” Robert insisted with a hint of his old fierceness. “What part of that don’t
you understand, woman?”
Cersei gathered up her skirts and her dignity and led the way to the door. Lord Renly
and the others followed. Grand Maester Pycelle lingered, his hands shaking as he offered
the king a cup of thick white liquid. “The milk of the poppy, Your Grace,” he said. “Drink.
For your pain.”
Robert knocked the cup away with the back of his hand. “Away with you. I’ll sleep soon
enough, old fool. Get out.”
Grand Maester Pycelle gave Ned a stricken look as he shuffled from the room.
“Damn you, Robert,” Ned said when they were alone. His leg was throbbing so badly he
was almost blind with pain. Or perhaps it was grief that fogged his eyes. He lowered
himself to the bed, beside his friend. “Why do you always have to be so headstrong?”
“Ah, fuck you, Ned,” the king said hoarsely. “I killed the bastard, didn’t I?” A lock of
matted black hair fell across his eyes as he glared up at Ned. “Ought to do the same for
you. Can’t leave a man to hunt in peace. Ser Robar found me. Gregor’s head. Ugly
thought. Never told the Hound. Let Cersei surprise him.” His laugh turned into a grunt
as a spasm of pain hit him. “Gods have mercy,” he muttered, swallowing his agony. “The
girl. Daenerys. Only a child, you were right . . . that’s why, the girl . . . the gods sent the
boar . . . sent to punish me . . .” The king coughed, bringing up blood. “Wrong, it was
wrong, I . . . only a girl . . . Varys, Littlefinger, even my brother . . . worthless . . . no one

to tell me no but you, Ned . . . only you . . . ” He lifted his hand, the gesture pained and
feeble. “Paper and ink. There, on the table. Write what I tell you.”
Ned smoothed the paper out across his knee and took up the quill. “At your command,
Your Grace.”
“This is the will and word of Robert of House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of
the Andals and all the rest—put in the damn titles, you know how it goes. I do hereby
command Eddard of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King, to serve as
Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my . . . upon my death . . . to rule in
my . . . in my stead, until my son Joffrey does come of age . . . ”
“Robert . . . ” Joffrey is not your son, he wanted to say, but the words would not come.
The agony was written too plainly across Robert’s face; he could not hurt him more. So
Ned bent his head and wrote, but where the king had said “my son Joffrey,” he scrawled
“my heir” instead. The deceit made him feel soiled. The lies we tell for love, he thought.
May the gods forgive me. “What else would you have me say?”
“Say . . . whatever you need to. Protect and defend, gods old and new, you have the
words. Write. I’ll sign it. You give it to the council when I’m dead.”
“Robert,” Ned said in a voice thick with grief, “you must not do this. Don’t die on me.
The realm needs you.”
Robert took his hand, fingers squeezing hard. “You are . . . such a bad liar, Ned Stark,”
he said through his pain. “The realm . . . the realm knows . . . what a wretched king I’ve
been. Bad as Aerys, the gods spare me.”
“No,” Ned told his dying friend, “not so bad as Aerys, Your Grace. Not near so bad as
Aerys.”
Robert managed a weak red smile. “At the least, they will say . . . this last thing . . . this I
did right. You won’t fail me. You’ll rule now. You’ll hate it, worse than I did . . . but you’ll
do well. Are you done with the scribbling?”
“Yes, Your Grace.” Ned offered Robert the paper. The king scrawled his signature
blindly, leaving a smear of blood across the letter. “The seal should be witnessed.”
“Serve the boar at my funeral feast,” Robert rasped. “Apple in its mouth, skin seared
crisp. Eat the bastard. Don’t care if you choke on him. Promise me, Ned.”
“I promise.” Promise me, Ned, Lyanna’s voice echoed.

“The girl,” the king said. “Daenerys. Let her live. If you can, if it . . . not too late . . . talk
to them . . . Varys, Littlefinger . . . don’t let them kill her. And help my son, Ned. Make
him be . . . better than me.” He winced. “Gods have mercy.”
“They will, my friend,” Ned said. “They will.”
The king closed his eyes and seemed to relax. “Killed by a pig,” he muttered. “Ought to
laugh, but it hurts too much.”
Ned was not laughing. “Shall I call them back?”
Robert gave a weak nod. “As you will. Gods, why is it so cold in here?”
The servants rushed back in and hurried to feed the fires. The queen had gone; that was
some small relief, at least. If she had any sense, Cersei would take her children and fly
before the break of day, Ned thought. She had lingered too long already.
King Robert did not seem to miss her. He bid his brother Renly and Grand Maester
Pycelle to stand in witness as he pressed his seal into the hot yellow wax that Ned had
dripped upon his letter. “Now give me something for the pain and let me die.”
Hurriedly Grand Maester Pycelle mixed him another draught of the milk of the poppy.
This time the king drank deeply. His black beard was beaded with thick white droplets
when he threw the empty cup aside. “Will I dream?”
Ned gave him his answer. “You will, my lord.”
“Good,” he said, smiling. “I will give Lyanna your love, Ned. Take care of my children for
me.”
The words twisted in Ned’s belly like a knife. For a moment he was at a loss. He could
not bring himself to lie. Then he remembered the bastards: little Barra at her mother’s
breast, Mya in the Vale, Gendry at his forge, and all the others. “I shall . . . guard your
children as if they were my own,” he said slowly.
Robert nodded and closed his eyes. Ned watched his old friend sag softly into the pillows
as the milk of the poppy washed the pain from his face. Sleep took him.
Heavy chains jangled softly as Grand Maester Pycelle came up to Ned. “I will do all in
my power, my lord, but the wound has mortified. It took them two days to get him back.

By the time I saw him, it was too late. I can lessen His Grace’s suffering, but only the
gods can heal him now.”
“How long?” Ned asked.
“By rights, he should be dead already. I have never seen a man cling to life so fiercely.”
“My brother was always strong,” Lord Renly said. “Not wise, perhaps, but strong.” In the
sweltering heat of the bedchamber, his brow was slick with sweat. He might have been
Robert’s ghost as he stood there, young and dark and handsome. “He slew the boar. His
entrails were sliding from his belly, yet somehow he slew the boar.” His voice was full of
wonder.
“Robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained standing,”
Ned told him.
Outside the door, Ser Barristan Selmy still guarded the tower stairs. “Maester Pycelle
has given Robert the milk of the poppy,” Ned told him. “See that no one disturbs his rest
without leave from me.”
“It shall be as you command, my lord.” Ser Barristan seemed old beyond his years. “I
have failed my sacred trust.”
“Even the truest knight cannot protect a king against himself,” Ned said. “Robert loved
to hunt boar. I have seen him take a thousand of them.” He would stand his ground
without flinching, his legs braced, the great spear in his hands, and as often as not he
would curse the boar as it charged, and wait until the last possible second, until it was
almost on him, before he killed it with a single sure and savage thrust. “No one could
know this one would be his death.”
“You are kind to say so, Lord Eddard.”
“The king himself said as much. He blamed the wine.”
The white-haired knight gave a weary nod. “His Grace was reeling in his saddle by the
time we flushed the boar from his lair, yet he commanded us all to stand aside.”
“I wonder, Ser Barristan,” asked Varys, so quietly, “who gave the king this wine?”
Ned had not heard the eunuch approach, but when he looked around, there he stood. He
wore a black velvet robe that brushed the floor, and his face was freshly powdered.

“The wine was from the king’s own skin,” Ser Barristan said.
“Only one skin? Hunting is such thirsty work.”
“I did not keep count. More than one, for a certainty. His squire would fetch him a fresh
skin whenever he required it.”
“Such a dutiful boy,” said Varys, “to make certain His Grace did not lack for
refreshment.”
Ned had a bitter taste in his mouth. He recalled the two fair-haired boys Robert had sent
chasing after a breastplate stretcher. The king had told everyone the tale that night at the
feast, laughing until he shook. “Which squire?”
“The elder,” said Ser Barristan. “Lancel.”
“I know the lad well,” said Varys. “A stalwart boy, Ser Kevan Lannister’s son, nephew to
Lord Tywin and cousin to the queen. I hope the dear sweet lad does not blame himself.
Children are so vulnerable in the innocence of their youth, how well do I remember.”
Certainly Varys had once been young. Ned doubted that he had ever been innocent. “You
mention children. Robert had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
Whatever arrangements you made, I want unmade. At once.”
“Alas,” said Varys. “At once may be too late. I fear those birds have flown. But I shall do
what I can, my lord. With your leave.” He bowed and vanished down the steps, his softsoled slippers whispering against the stone as he made his descent.
Cayn and Tomard were helping Ned across the bridge when Lord Renly emerged from
Maegor’s Holdfast. “Lord Eddard,” he called after Ned, “a moment, if you would be so
kind.”
Ned stopped. “As you wish.”
Renly walked to his side. “Send your men away.” They met in the center of the bridge,
the dry moat beneath them. Moonlight silvered the cruel edges of the spikes that lined
its bed.
Ned gestured. Tomard and Cayn bowed their heads and backed away respectfully. Lord
Renly glanced warily at Ser Boros on the far end of the span, at Ser Preston in the
doorway behind them. “That letter.” He leaned close. “Was it the regency? Has my

brother named you Protector?” He did not wait for a reply. “My lord, I have thirty men
in my personal guard, and other friends beside, knights and lords. Give me an hour, and
I can put a hundred swords in your hand.”
“And what should I do with a hundred swords, my lord?”
“Strike! Now, while the castle sleeps.” Renly looked back at Ser Boros again and dropped
his voice to an urgent whisper. “We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him
in hand. Protector or no, the man who holds the king holds the kingdom. We should
seize Myrcella and Tommen as well. Once we have her children, Cersei will not dare
oppose us. The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and make Joffrey your ward.”
Ned regarded him coldly. “Robert is not dead yet. The gods may spare him. If not, I shall
convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession,
but I will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and
dragging frightened children from their beds.”
Lord Renly took a step back, taut as a bowstring. “Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare. By the time Robert dies, it may be too late . . . for both of
us.”
“Then we should pray that Robert does not die.”
“Small chance of that,” said Renly.
“Sometimes the gods are merciful.”
“The Lannisters are not.” Lord Renly turned away and went back across the moat, to the
tower where his brother lay dying.
By the time Ned returned to his chambers, he felt weary and heartsick, yet there was no
question of his going back to sleep, not now. When you play the game of thrones, you
win or you die, Cersei Lannister had told him in the godswood. He found himself
wondering if he had done the right thing by refusing Lord Renly’s offer. He had no taste
for these intrigues, and there was no honor in threatening children, and yet . . . if Cersei
elected to fight rather than flee, he might well have need of Renly’s hundred swords, and
more besides.
“I want Littlefinger,” he told Cayn. “If he’s not in his chambers, take as many men as you
need and search every winesink and whorehouse in King’s Landing until you find him.
Bring him to me before break of day.” Cayn bowed and took his leave, and Ned turned to
Tomard. “The Wind Witch sails on the evening tide. Have you chosen the escort?”

“Ten men, with Porther in command.”
“Twenty, and you will command,” Ned said. Porther was a brave man, but headstrong.
He wanted someone more solid and sensible to keep watch over his daughters.
“As you wish, m’lord,” Tom said. “Can’t say I’ll be sad to see the back of this place. I miss
the wife.”
“You will pass near Dragonstone when you turn north. I need you to deliver a letter for
me.”
Tom looked apprehensive. “To Dragonstone, m’lord?” The island fortress of House
Targaryen had a sinister repute.
“Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island. They
may be wary of unexpected visitors. If he is reluctant, offer him whatever it takes. I will
give you a letter to place into the hand of Lord Stannis Baratheon. No one else. Not his
steward, nor the captain of his guard, nor his lady wife, but only Lord Stannis himself.”
“As you command, m’lord.”
When Tomard had left him, Lord Eddard Stark sat staring at the flame of the candle that
burned beside him on the table. For a moment his grief overwhelmed him. He wanted
nothing so much as to seek out the godswood, to kneel before the heart tree and pray for
the life of Robert Baratheon, who had been more than a brother to him. Men would
whisper afterward that Eddard Stark had betrayed his king’s friendship and disinherited
his sons; he could only hope that the gods would know better, and that Robert would
learn the truth of it in the land beyond the grave.
Ned took out the king’s last letter. A roll of crisp white parchment sealed with golden
wax, a few short words and a smear of blood. How small the difference between victory
and defeat, between life and death.
He drew out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his quill in the inkpot. To His Grace,
Stannis of the House Baratheon, he wrote. By the time you receive this letter, your
brother Robert, our King these past fifteen years, will be dead. He was savaged by a
boar whilst hunting in the kingswood . . .
The letters seemed to writhe and twist on the paper as his hand trailed to a stop. Lord
Tywin and Ser Jaime were not men to suffer disgrace meekly; they would fight rather
than flee. No doubt Lord Stannis was wary, after the murder of Jon Arryn, but it was

imperative that he sail for King’s Landing at once with all his power, before the
Lannisters could march.
Ned chose each word with care. When he was done, he signed the letter Eddard Stark,
Lord of Winterfell, Hand of the King, and Protector of the Realm, blotted the paper,
folded it twice, and melted the sealing wax over the candle flame.
His regency would be a short one, he reflected as the wax softened. The new king would
choose his own Hand. Ned would be free to go home. The thought of Winterfell brought
a wan smile to his face. He wanted to hear Bran’s laughter once more, to go hawking
with Robb, to watch Rickon at play. He wanted to drift off to a dreamless sleep in his
own bed with his arms wrapped tight around his lady, Catelyn.
Cayn returned as he was pressing the direwolf seal down into the soft white wax.
Desmond was with him, and between them Littlefinger. Ned thanked his guards and
sent them away.
Lord Petyr was clad in a blue velvet tunic with puffed sleeves, his silvery cape patterned
with mockingbirds. “I suppose congratulations are in order,” he said as he seated
himself.
Ned scowled. “The king lies wounded and near to death.”
“I know,” Littlefinger said. “I also know that Robert has named you Protector of the
Realm.”
Ned’s eyes flicked to the king’s letter on the table beside him, its seal unbroken. “And
how is it you know that, my lord?”
“Varys hinted as much,” Littlefinger said, “and you have just confirmed it.”
Ned’s mouth twisted in anger. “Damn Varys and his little birds. Catelyn spoke truly, the
man has some black art. I do not trust him.”
“Excellent. You’re learning.” Littlefinger leaned forward. “Yet I’ll wager you did not drag
me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch.”
“No,” Ned admitted. “I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect. Robert will
leave no trueborn son behind him. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister’s bastards,
born of his incestuous union with the queen.”
Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow. “Shocking,” he said in a tone that suggested he was not

shocked at all. “The girl as well? No doubt. So when the king dies . . . ”
“The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis, the elder of Robert’s two brothers.”
Lord Petyr stroked his pointed beard as he considered the matter. “So it would seem.
Unless . . . ”
“Unless, my lord? There is no seeming to this. Stannis is the heir. Nothing can change
that.”
“Stannis cannot take the throne without your help. If you’re wise, you’ll make certain
Joffrey succeeds.”
Ned gave him a stony stare. “Have you no shred of honor?”
“Oh, a shred, surely,” Littlefinger replied negligently. “Hear me out. Stannis is no friend
of yours, nor of mine. Even his brothers can scarcely stomach him. The man is iron, hard
and unyielding. He’ll give us a new Hand and a new council, for a certainty. No doubt
he’ll thank you for handing him the crown, but he won’t love you for it. And his ascent
will mean war. Stannis cannot rest easy on the throne until Cersei and her bastards are
dead. Do you think Lord Tywin will sit idly while his daughter’s head is measured for a
spike? Casterly Rock will rise, and not alone. Robert found it in him to pardon men who
served King Aerys, so long as they did him fealty. Stannis is less forgiving. He will not
have forgotten the siege of Storm’s End, and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dare not.
Every man who fought beneath the dragon banner or rose with Balon Greyjoy will have
good cause to fear. Seat Stannis on the Iron Throne and I promise you, the realm will
bleed.
“Now look at the other side of the coin. Joffrey is but twelve, and Robert gave you the
regency, my lord. You are the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm. The power is
yours, Lord Stark. All you need do is reach out and take it. Make your peace with the
Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed Joffrey to your Sansa. Wed your younger girl to Prince
Tommen, and your heir to Myrcella. It will be four years before Joffrey comes of age. By
then he will look to you as a second father, and if not, well . . . four years is a good long
while, my lord. Long enough to dispose of Lord Stannis. Then, should Joffrey prove
troublesome, we can reveal his little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne.”
“We?” Ned repeated.
Littlefinger gave a shrug. “You’ll need someone to share your burdens. I assure you, my
price would be modest.”

“Your price.” Ned’s voice was ice. “Lord Baelish, what you suggest is treason.”
“Only if we lose.”
“You forget,” Ned told him. “You forget Jon Arryn. You forget Jory Cassel. And you
forget this.” He drew the dagger and laid it on the table between them; a length of
dragonbone and Valyrian steel, as sharp as the difference between right and wrong,
between true and false, between life and death. “They sent a man to cut my son’s throat,
Lord Baelish.”
Littlefinger sighed. “I fear I did forget, my lord. Pray forgive me. For a moment I did not
remember that I was talking to a Stark.” His mouth quirked. “So it will be Stannis, and
war?”
“It is not a choice. Stannis is the heir.”
“Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector. What would you have of me, then? Not
my wisdom, for a certainty.”
“I shall do my best to forget your . . . wisdom,” Ned said with distaste. “I called you here
to ask for the help you promised Catelyn. This is a perilous hour for all of us. Robert has
named me Protector, true enough, but in the eyes of the world, Joffrey is still his son and
heir. The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms who will do whatever
she commands . . . enough to overwhelm what remains of my own household guard.
And for all I know, her brother Jaime may be riding for King’s Landing even as we
speak, with a Lannister host at his back.”
“And you without an army.” Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table, turning it
slowly with a finger. “There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters.
Bronze Yohn Royce, Ser Balon Swann, Ser Loras, Lady Tanda, the Redwyne
twins . . . each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court.”
“Renly has thirty men in his personal guard, the rest even fewer. It is not enough, even if
I could be certain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance. I must have the
gold cloaks. The City Watch is two thousand strong, sworn to defend the castle, the city,
and the king’s peace.”
“Ah, but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another, whose peace do they
protect?” Lord Petyr flicked at the dagger with his finger, setting it spinning in place.
Round and round it went, wobbling as it turned. When at last it slowed to a stop, the
blade pointed at Littlefinger. “Why, there’s your answer,” he said, smiling. “They follow
the man who pays them.” He leaned back and looked Ned full in the face, his grey-green

eyes bright with mockery. “You wear your honor like a suit of armor, Stark. You think it
keeps you safe, but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move. Look
at you now. You know why you summoned me here. You know what you want to ask me
to do. You know it has to be done . . . but it’s not honorable, so the words stick in your
throat.”
Ned’s neck was rigid with tension. For a moment he was so angry that he did not trust
himself to speak.
Littlefinger laughed. “I ought to make you say it, but that would be cruel . . . so have no
fear, my good lord. For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn, I will go to Janos Slynt this
very hour and make certain that the City Watch is yours. Six thousand gold pieces
should do it. A third for the Commander, a third for the officers, a third for the men. We
might be able to buy them for half that much, but I prefer not to take chances.” Smiling,
he plucked up the dagger and offered it to Ned, hilt first.

JON
Jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped
himself down on the bench. “I’ve been summoned to the sept,” Sam said in an excited
whisper. “They’re passing me out of training. I’m to be made a brother with the rest of
you. Can you believe it?”
“No, truly?”
“Truly. I’m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds. He needs someone
who can read and write letters.”
“You’ll do well at that,” Jon said, smiling.
Sam glanced about anxiously. “Is it time to go? I shouldn’t be late, they might change
their minds.” He was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn courtyard. The
day was warm and sunny. Rivulets of water trickled down the sides of the Wall, so the ice
seemed to sparkle and shine.
Inside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the
south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar. Pyp’s mouth dropped open
when he caught sight of Sam, and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs, but no one dared say a
word. Septon Celladar was swinging a censer, filling the air with fragrant incense that
reminded Jon of Lady Stark’s little sept in Winterfell. For once the septon seemed sober.
The high officers arrived in a body; Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas, Ser Alliser coldeyed and grim, Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with
silvered bearclaw fastenings. Behind them came the senior members of the three orders:
red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward, First Builder Othell Yarwyck, and Ser Jaremy
Rykker, who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark.
Mormont stood before the altar, the rainbow shining on his broad bald head. “You came
to us outlaws,” he began, “poachers, rapers, debtors, killers, and thieves. You came to us
children. You came to us alone, in chains, with neither friends nor honor. You came to us
rich, and you came to us poor. Some of you bear the names of proud houses. Others have
only bastards’ names, or no names at all. It makes no matter. All that is past now. On the
Wall, we are all one house.

“At evenfall, as the sun sets and we face the gathering night, you shall take your vows.
From that moment, you will be a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch. Your crimes will
be washed away, your debts forgiven. So too you must wash away your former loyalties,
put aside your grudges, forget old wrongs and old loves alike. Here you begin anew.
“A man of the Night’s Watch lives his life for the realm. Not for a king, nor a lord, nor the
honor of this house or that house, neither for gold nor glory nor a woman’s love, but for
the realm, and all the people in it. A man of the Night’s Watch takes no wife and fathers
no sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor. And you are the only sons we shall ever
know.
“You have learned the words of the vow. Think carefully before you say them, for once
you have taken the black, there is no turning back. The penalty for desertion is death.”
The Old Bear paused for a moment before he said, “Are there any among you who wish
to leave our company? If so, go now, and no one shall think the less of you.”
No one moved.
“Well and good,” said Mormont. “You may take your vows here at evenfall, before
Septon Celladar and the first of your order. Do any of you keep to the old gods?”
Jon stood. “I do, my lord.”
“I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your uncle did,”
Mormont said.
“Yes, my lord,” Jon said. The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of
the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks.
He heard Grenn whispering behind him. “There’s no godswood here. Is there? I never
saw a godswood.”
“You wouldn’t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow,” Pyp
whispered back.
“I would so,” Grenn insisted. “I’d see them a long way off.”
Mormont himself confirmed Grenn’s doubts. “Castle Black has no need of a godswood.
Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age, long before the
Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea. You will find a grove of weirwoods half
a league from this spot, and mayhap your gods as well.”

“My lord.” The voice made Jon glance back in surprise. Samwell Tarly was on his feet.
The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic. “Might I . . . might I go as well? To
say my words at this heart tree?”
“Does House Tarly keep the old gods too?” Mormont asked.
“No, my lord,” Sam replied in a thin, nervous voice. The high officers frightened him,
Jon knew, the Old Bear most of all. “I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on
Horn Hill, as my father was, and his father, and all the Tarlys for a thousand years.”
“Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?” wondered Ser Jaremy
Rykker.
“The Night’s Watch is my House now,” Sam said. “The Seven have never answered my
prayers. Perhaps the old gods will.”
“As you wish, boy,” Mormont said. Sam took his seat again, as did Jon. “We have placed
each of you in an order, as befits our need and your own strengths and skills.” Bowen
Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper. The Lord Commander unrolled it and
began to read. “Haider, to the builders,” he began. Haider gave a stiff nod of approval.
“Grenn, to the rangers. Albett, to the builders. Pypar, to the rangers.” Pyp looked over at
Jon and wiggled his ears. “Samwell, to the stewards.” Sam sagged with relief, mopping at
his brow with,a scrap of silk. “Matthar, to the rangers. Dareon, to the stewards. Todder,
to the rangers. Jon, to the stewards.”
The stewards? For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard. Mormont must
have read it wrong. He started to rise, to open his mouth, to tell them there had been a
mistake . . . and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him, eyes shiny as two flakes of
obsidian, and he knew.
The Old Bear rolled up the paper. “Your firsts will instruct you in your duties. May all the
gods preserve you, brothers.” The Lord Commander favored them with a half bow, and
took his leave. Ser Alliser went with him, a thin smile on his face. Jon had never seen the
master-at-arms took quite so happy.
“Rangers with me,” Ser Jaremy Rykker called when they were gone. Pyp was staring at
Jon as he got slowly to his feet. His ears were red. Grenn, grinning broadly, did not seem
to realize that anything was amiss. Matt and Toad fell in beside them, and they followed
Ser Jaremy from the sept.
“Builders,” announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck. Haider and Albett trailed out after

him.
Jon looked around him in sick disbelief. Maester Aemon’s blind eyes were raised toward
the light he could not see. The septon was arranging crystals on the altar. Only Sam and
Darcon remained on the benches; a fat boy, a singer . . . and him.
Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together. “Samwell, you will assist
Maester Aemon in the rookery and library. Chett is going to the kennels, to help with the
hounds. You shall have his cell, so as to be close to the maester night and day. I trust you
will take good care of him. He is very old and very precious to us.
“Dareon, I am told that you sang at many a high lord’s table and shared their meat and
mead. We are sending you to Eastwatch. It may be your palate will be some help to
Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys come trading. We are paying too dear for salt beef
and pickled fish, and the quality of the olive oil we’re getting has been frightful, Present
yourself to Borcas when you arrive, he will keep you busy between ships.”
Marsh turned his smile on Jon. “Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his
personal steward, Jon. You’ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers, in the Lord
Commander’s tower.”
“And what will my duties be?” Jon asked sharply. “Will I serve the Lord Commander’s
meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath?”
“Certainly.” Marsh frowned at Jon’s tone. “And you will run his messages, keep a fire
burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all else that the
Lord Commander might require of you.”
“Do you take me for a servant?”
“No,” Maester Aemon said, from the back of the sept. Clydas helped him stand. “We took
you for a man of the Night’s Watch . . . but perhaps we were wrong in that.”
It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out. Was he supposed to churn
butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days? “May I go?” he asked stiffly.
“As you wish,” Bowen Marsh responded.
Dareon and Sam left with him. They descended to the yard in silence. Outside, Jon
looked up at the Wall shining in the sun, the melting ice creeping down its side in a
hundred thin fingers. Jon’s rage was such that he would have smashed it all in an
instant, and the world be damned.

“Jon,” Samwell Tarly said excitedly. “Wait. Don’t you see what they’re doing?”
Jon turned on him in a fury. “I see Ser Alliser’s bloody hand, that’s all I see. He wanted
to shame me, and he has.”
Dareon gave him a look. “The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, Sam, but not
for Lord Snow.”
“I’m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you,” Jon blazed back. “It’s not
fair!”
“Fair?” Dareon sneered. “The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day she was born.
She pulled me through the window, and you talk to me of fair?” He walked off.
“There is no shame in being a steward,” Sam said.
“Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man’s smallclothes?”
“The old man is Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch,” Sam reminded him. “You’ll be
with him day and night. Yes, you’ll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh, but
you’ll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle. You’ll be as
close to him as his shadow. You’ll know everything, be a part of everything . . . and the
Lord Steward said Mormont asked for you himself!
“When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber
whenever he held court. When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell, he
made me come. Later, though, he started to take Dickon and leave me at home, and he
no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences, so long as Dickon was there. He
wanted his heir at his side, don’t you see? To watch and listen and learn from all he did.
I’ll wager that’s why Lord Mormont requested you, Jon. What else could it be? He wants
to groom you for command!”
Jon was taken aback. It was true, Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils
back at Winterfell. Could Sam be right? Even a bastard could rise high in the Night’s
Watch, they said. “I never asked for this,” he said stubbornly.
“None of us are here for asking,” Sam reminded him.
And suddenly Jon Snow was ashamed.

Craven or not, Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man. On the
Wall, a man gets only what he earns, Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen
him alive. You’re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on
you. He’d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children; on the Wall,
you grew up or you died.
Jon let out a deep sigh. “You have the right of it. I was acting the boy.”
“Then you’ll stay and say your words with me?”
“The old gods will be expecting us.” He made himself smile.
They set out late that afternoon. The Wall had no gates as such, neither here at Castle
Black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles. They led their horses down a narrow
tunnel cut through the ice, cold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage
twisted and turned. Three times their way was blocked by iron bars, and they had to stop
while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured
them. Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on him as he waited behind the
Lord Steward. The air was colder than a tomb, and more still. He felt a strange relief
when they reemerged into the afternoon light on the north side of the Wall.
Sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively. “The
wildlings . . . they wouldn’t . . . they’d never dare come this close to the Wall. Would
they?”
“They never have.” Jon climbed into his saddle. When Bowen Marsh and their ranger
escort had mounted, Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled. Ghost came loping
out of the tunnel.
The Lord Steward’s garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf. “Do you mean
to take that beast?”
“Yes, my lord,” Jon said. Ghost’s head lifted. He seemed to taste the air. In the blink of
an eye he was off, racing across the broad, weed-choked field to vanish in the trees.
Once they had entered the forest, they were in a different world. Jon had often hunted
with his father and Jory and his brother Robb. He knew the wolfswood around
Winterfell as well as any man. The haunted forest was much the same, and yet the feel of
it was very different.
Perhaps it was all in the knowing. They had ridden past the end of the world; somehow
that changed everything. Every shadow seemed darker, every sound more ominous. The

trees pressed close and shut out the light of the setting sun. A thin crust of snow cracked
beneath the hooves of their horses, with a sound like breaking bones. When the wind set
the leaves to rustling, it was like a chilly finger tracing a path up Jon’s spine. The Wall
was at their backs, and only the gods knew what lay ahead.
The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination, a small
clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle. Jon drew
in a breath, and he saw Sam Tarly staring. Even in the wolfswood, you never found more
than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove of nine was unheard of.
The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves, bloodred on top, black rot beneath. The
wide smooth trunks were bone pale, and nine faces stared inward. The dried sap that
crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby. Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave
their horses outside the circle. “This is a sacred place, we will not defile it.”
When they entered the grove, Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn.
No two were quite alike. “They’re watching us,” he whispered. “The old gods.”
“Yes.” Jon knelt, and Sam knelt beside him.
They said the words together, as the last light faded in the west and grey day became
black night.
“Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow,” they recited, their voices filling the twilit
grove. “Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall
take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the
walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn
that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and
honor to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.”
The woods fell silent. “You knelt as boys,” Bowen Marsh intoned solemnly. “Rise now as
men of the Night’s Watch.”
Jon held out a hand to pull Sam back to his feet. The rangers gathered round to offer
smiles and congratulations, all but the gnarled old forester Dywen. “Best we be starting
back, m’lord,” he said to Bowen Marsh. “Dark’s falling, and there’s something in the
smell o’ the night that I mislike.”
And suddenly Ghost was back, stalking softly between two weirwoods. White fur and red
eyes, Jon realized, disquieted. Like the trees . . .
The wolf had something in his jaws. Something black. “What’s he got there?” asked

Bowen Marsh, frowning.
“To me, Ghost.” Jon knelt. “Bring it here.”
The direwolf trotted to him. Jon heard Samwell Tarly’s sharp intake of breath.
“Gods be good,” Dywen muttered. “That’s a hand.”

EDDARD
The grey light of dawn was streaming through his window when the thunder of
hoofbeats awoke Eddard Stark from his brief, exhausted sleep. He lifted his head from
the table to look down into the yard. Below, men in mail and leather and crimson cloaks
were making the morning ring to the sound of swords, and riding down mock warriors
stuffed with straw. Ned watched Sandor Clegane gallop across the hard-packed ground
to drive an iron-tipped lance through a dummy’s head. Canvas ripped and straw
exploded as Lannister guardsmen joked and cursed.
Is this brave show for my benefit? he wondered. If so, Cersei was a greater fool than
he’d imagined. Damn her, he thought, why is the woman not fled? I have given her
chance after chance . . .
The morning was overcast and grim. Ned broke his fast with his daughters and Septa
Mordane. Sansa, still disconsolate, stared sullenly at her food and refused to eat, but
Arya wolfed down everything that was set in front of her. “Syrio says we have time for
one last lesson before we take ship this evening,” she said. “Can I, Father? All my things
are packed.”
“A short lesson, and make certain you leave yourself time to bathe and change. I want
you ready to leave by midday, is that understood?”
“By midday,” Arya said.
Sansa looked up from her food. “If she can have a dancing lesson, why won’t you let me
say farewell to Prince Joffrey?”
“I would gladly go with her, Lord Eddard,” Septa Mordane offered. “There would be no
question of her missing the ship.”
“It would not be wise for you to go to Joffrey right now, Sansa. I’m sorry.”
Sansa’s eyes filled with tears. “But why?”
“Sansa, your lord father knows best,” Septa Mordane said. “You are not to question his
decisions.”

“It’s not fair!” Sansa pushed back from her table, knocked over her chair, and ran
weeping from the solar.
Septa Mordane rose, but Ned gestured her back to her seat. “Let her go, Septa. I will try
to make her understand when we are all safely back in Winterfell.” The septa bowed her
head and sat down to finish her breakfast.
It was an hour later when Grand Maester Pycelle came to Eddard Stark in his solar. His
shoulders slumped, as if the weight of the great maester’s chain around his neck had
become too great to bear. “My lord,” he said, “King Robert is gone. The gods give him
rest.”
“No,” Ned answered. “He hated rest. The gods give him love and laughter, and the joy of
righteous battle.” It was strange how empty he felt. He had been expecting the visit, and
yet with those words, something died within him. He would have given all his titles for
the freedom to weep . . . but he was Robert’s Hand, and the hour he dreaded had come.
“Be so good as to summon the members of the council here to my solar,” he told Pycelle.
The Tower of the Hand was as secure as he and Tomard could make it; he could not say
the same for the council chambers.
“My lord?” Pycelle blinked. “Surely the affairs of the kingdom will keep till the morrow,
when our grief is not so fresh.”
Ned was quiet but firm. “I fear we must convene at once.”
Pycelle bowed. “As the Hand commands.” He called his servants and sent them running,
then gratefully accepted Ned’s offer of a chair and a cup of sweet beer.
Ser Barristan Selmy was the first to answer the summons, immaculate in white cloak
and enameled scales. “My lords,” he said, “my place is beside the young king now. Pray
give me leave to attend him.”
“Your place is here, Ser Barristan,” Ned told him.
Littlefinger came next, still garbed in the blue velvets and silver mockingbird cape he
had worn the night previous, his boots dusty from riding. “My lords,” he said, smiling at
nothing in particular before he turned to Ned. “That little task you set me is
accomplished, Lord Eddard.”
Varys entered in a wash of lavender, pink from his bath, his plump face scrubbed and
freshly powdered, his soft slippers all but soundless. “The little birds sing a grievous

song today,” he said as he seated himself. “The realm weeps. Shall we begin?”
“When Lord Renly arrives,” Ned said.
Varys gave him a sorrowful look. “I fear Lord Renly has left the city.”
“Left the city?” Ned had counted on Renly’s support.
“He took his leave through a postern gate an hour before dawn, accompanied by Ser
Loras Tyrell and some fifty retainers,” Varys told them. “When last seen, they were
galloping south in some haste, no doubt bound for Storm’s End or Highgarden.”
So much for Renly and his hundred swords. Ned did not like the smell of that, but there
was nothing to be done for it. He drew out Robert’s last letter. “The king called me to his
side last night and commanded me to record his final words. Lord Renly and Grand
Maester Pycelle stood witness as Robert sealed the letter, to be opened by the council
after his death. Ser Barristan, if you would be so kind?”
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard examined the paper. “King Robert’s seal, and
unbroken.” He opened the letter and read. “Lord Eddard Stark is herein named
Protector of the Realm, to rule as regent until the heir comes of age.”
And as it happens, he is of age, Ned reflected, but he did not give voice to the thought.
He trusted neither Pycelle nor Varys, and Ser Barristan was honor-bound to protect and
defend the boy he thought his new king. The old knight would not abandon Joffrey
easily. The need for deceit was a bitter taste in his mouth, but Ned knew he must tread
softly here, must keep his counsel and play the game until he was firmly established as
regent. There would be time enough to deal with the succession when Arya and Sansa
were safely back in Winterfell, and Lord Stannis had returned to King’s Landing with all
his power.
“I would ask this council to confirm me as Lord Protector, as Robert wished,” Ned said,
watching their faces, wondering what thoughts hid behind Pycelle’s half-closed eyes,
Littlefinger’s lazy half-smile, and the nervous flutter of Varys’s fingers.
The door opened. Fat Tom stepped into the solar. “Pardon, my lords, the king’s steward
insists . . . ”
The royal steward entered and bowed. “Esteemed lords, the king demands the
immediate presence of his small council in the throne room.”
Ned had expected Cersei to strike quickly; the summons came as no surprise. “The king

is dead,” he said, “but we shall go with you nonetheless. Tom, assemble an escort, if you
would.”
Littlefinger gave Ned his arm to help him down the steps. Varys, Pycelle, and Ser
Barristan followed close behind. A double column of men-at-arms in chainmail and steel
helms was waiting outside the tower, eight strong. Grey cloaks snapped in the wind as
the guardsmen marched them across the yard. There was no Lannister crimson to be
seen, but Ned was reassured by the number of gold cloaks visible on the ramparts and at
the gates.
Janos Slynt met them at the door to the throne room, armored in ornate black-and-gold
plate, with a high-crested helm under one arm. The Commander bowed stiffly. His men
pushed open the great oaken doors, twenty feet tall and banded with bronze.
The royal steward led them in. “All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and
Lannister, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,” he sang out.
It was a long walk to the far end of the hall, where Joffrey waited atop the Iron Throne.
Supported by Littlefinger, Ned Stark slowly limped and hopped toward the boy who
called himself king. The others followed. The first time he had come this way, he had
been on horseback, sword in hand, and the Targaryen dragons had watched from the
walls as he forced Jaime Lannister down from the throne. He wondered if Joffrey would
step down quite so easily.
Five knights of the Kingsguard—all but Ser Jaime and Ser Barristan—were arrayed in a
crescent around the base of the throne. They were in full armor, enameled steel from
helm to heel, long pale cloaks over their shoulders, shining white shields strapped to
their left arms. Cersei Lannister and her two younger children stood behind Ser Boros
and Ser Meryn. The queen wore a gown of sea-green silk, trimmed with Myrish lace as
pale as foam. On her finger was a golden ring with an emerald the size of a pigeon’s egg,
on her head a matching tiara.
Above them, Prince Joffrey sat amidst the barbs and spikes in a cloth-of-gold doublet
and a red satin cape. Sandor Clegane was stationed at the foot of the throne’s steep
narrow stair. He wore mail and soot-grey plate and his snarling dog’s-head helm.
Behind the throne, twenty Lannister guardsmen waited with longswords hanging from
their belts. Crimson cloaks draped their shoulders and steel lions crested their helms.
But Littlefinger had kept his promise; all along the walls, in front of Robert’s tapestries
with their scenes of hunt and battle, the gold-cloaked ranks of the City Watch stood
stiffly to attention, each man’s hand clasped around the haft of an eight-foot-long spear

tipped in black iron. They outnumbered the Lannisters five to one.
Ned’s leg was a blaze of pain by the time he stopped. He kept a hand on Littlefinger’s
shoulder to help support his weight.
Joffrey stood. His red satin cape was patterned in gold thread; fifty roaring lions to one
side, fifty prancing stags to the other. “I command the council to make all the necessary
arrangements for my coronation,” the boy proclaimed. “I wish to be crowned within the
fortnight. Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors.”
Ned produced Robert’s letter. “Lord Varys, be so kind as to show this to my lady of
Lannister.”
The eunuch carried the letter to Cersei. The queen glanced at the words. “Protector of
the Realm,” she read. “Is this meant to be your shield, my lord? A piece of paper?” She
ripped the letter in half, ripped the halves in quarters, and let the pieces flutter to the
floor.
“Those were the king’s words,” Ser Barristan said, shocked.
“We have a new king now,” Cersei Lannister replied. “Lord Eddard, when last we spoke,
you gave me some counsel. Allow me to return the courtesy. Bend the knee, my lord.
Bend the knee and swear fealty to my son, and we shall allow you to step down as Hand
and live out your days in the grey waste you call home.”
“Would that I could,” Ned said grimly. If she was so determined to force the issue here
and now, she left him no choice. “Your son has no claim to the throne he sits. Lord
Stannis is Robert’s true heir.”
“Liar!” Joffrey screamed, his face reddening.
“Mother, what does he mean?” Princess Myrcella asked the queen plaintively. “Isn’t Joff
the king now?”
“You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark,” said Cersei Lannister. “Ser
Barristan, seize this traitor.”
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard hesitated. In the blink of an eye he was
surrounded by Stark guardsmen, bare steel in their mailed fists.
“And now the treason moves from words to deeds,” Cersei said. “Do you think Ser
Barristan stands alone, my lord?” With an ominous rasp of metal on metal, the Hound

drew his longsword. The knights of the Kingsguard and twenty Lannister guardsmen in
crimson cloaks moved to support him.
“Kill him!” the boy king screamed down from the Iron Throne. “Kill all of them, I
command it!”
“You leave me no choice,” Ned told Cersei Lannister. He called out to Janos Slynt.
“Commander, take the queen and her children into custody. Do them no harm, but
escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.”
“Men of the Watch!” Janos Slynt shouted, donning his helm. A hundred gold cloaks
leveled their spears and closed.
“I want no bloodshed,” Ned told the queen. “Tell your men to lay down their swords, and
no one need—”
With a single sharp thrust, the nearest gold cloak drove his spear into Tomard’s back.
Fat Tom’s blade dropped from nerveless fingers as the wet red point burst out through
his ribs, piercing leather and mail. He was dead before his sword hit the floor.
Ned’s shout came far too late. Janos Slynt himself slashed open Varly’s throat. Cayn
whirled, steel flashing, drove back the nearest spearman with a flurry of blows; for an
instant it looked as though he might cut his way free. Then the Hound was on him.
Sandor Clegane’s first cut took off Cayn’s sword hand at the wrist; his second drove him
to his knees and opened him from shoulder to breastbone.
As his men died around him, Littlefinger slid Ned’s dagger from its sheath and shoved it
up under his chin. His smile was apologetic. “I did warn you not to trust me, you know.”

ARYA
High,” Syrio Forel called out, slashing at her head. The stick swords clacked as Arya
parried.
“Left,” he shouted, and his blade came whistling. Hers darted to meet it. The clack made
him click his teeth together.
“Right,” he said, and “Low,” and “Left,” and “Left” again, faster and faster, moving
forward. Arya retreated before him, checking each blow.
“Lunge,” he warned, and when he thrust she sidestepped, swept his blade away, and
slashed at his shoulder. She almost touched him, almost, so close it made her grin. A
strand of hair dangled in her eyes, limp with sweat. She pushed it away with the back of
her hand.
“Left,” Syrio sang out. “Low.” His sword was a blur, and the Small Hall echoed to the
clack clack clack. “Left. Left. High. Left. Right. Left. Low. Left!”
The wooden blade caught her high in the breast, a sudden stinging blow that hurt all the
more because it came from the wrong side. “Ow,” she cried out. She would have a fresh
bruise there by the time she went to sleep, somewhere out at sea. A bruise is a lesson,
she told herself, and each lesson makes us better.
Syrio stepped back. “You are dead now.”
Arya made a face. “You cheated,” she said hotly. “You said left and you went right.”
“Just so. And now you are a dead girl.”
“But you lied!”
“My words lied. My eyes and my arm shouted out the truth, but you were not seeing.”
“I was so,” Arya said. “I watched you every second!”

“Watching is not seeing, dead girl. The water dancer sees. Come, put down the sword, it
is time for listening now.”
She followed him over to the wall, where he settled onto a bench. “Syrio Forel was first
sword to the Sealord of Braavos, and are you knowing how that came to pass?”
“You were the finest swordsman in the city.”
“Just so, but why? Other men were stronger, faster, younger, why was Syrio Forel the
best? I will tell you now.” He touched the tip of his little finger lightly to his eyelid. “The
seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of it.
“Hear me. The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow, to lands strange and
wonderful, and when they return their captains fetch queer animals to the Sealord’s
menagerie. Such animals as you have never seen, striped horses, great spotted things
with necks as long as stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging manticores, tigers
that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with scythes for claws. Syrio
Forel has seen these things.
“On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the Sealord sent for
me. Many bravos had come to him, and as many had been sent away, none could say
why. When I came into his presence, he was seated, and in his lap was a fat yellow cat.
He told me that one of his captains had brought the beast to him, from an island beyond
the sunrise. ‘Have you ever seen her like?’ he asked of me.
“And to him I said, ‘Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like him,’ and
the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named the first sword.”
Arya screwed up her face. “I don’t understand.”
Syrio clicked his teeth together. “The cat was an ordinary cat, no more. The others
expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw. How large it was, they said. It was no
larger than any other cat, only fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own
table. What curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten fights.
And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said ‘her,’ and that is what the others saw.
Are you hearing?”
Arya thought about it. “You saw what was there.”
“Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head plays tricks
with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your
mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward,

and in that way knowing the truth.”
“Just so,” said Arya, grinning.
Syrio Forel allowed himself a smile. “I am thinking that when we are reaching this
Winterfell of yours, it will be time to put this needle in your hand.”
“Yes!” Arya said eagerly. “Wait till I show Jon—”
Behind her the great wooden doors of the Small Hall flew open with a resounding crash.
Arya whirled.
A knight of the Kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five Lannister
guardsmen arrayed behind him. He was in full armor, but his visor was up. Arya
remembered his droopy eyes and rustcolored whiskers from when he had come to
Winterfell with the king: Ser Meryn Trant. The red cloaks wore mail shirts over boiled
leather and steel caps with lion crests. “Arya Stark,” the knight said, “come with us,
child.”
Arya chewed her lip uncertainly. “What do you want?”
“Your father wants to see you.”
Arya took a step forward, but Syrio Forel held her by the arm. “And why is it that Lord
Eddard is sending Lannister men in the place of his own? I am wondering.”
“Mind your place, dancing master,” Ser Meryn said. “This is no concern of yours.”
“My father wouldn’t send you,” Arya said. She snatched up her stick sword. The
Lannisters laughed.
“Put down the stick, girl,” Ser Meryn told her. “I am a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard,
the White Swords.”
“So was the Kingslayer when he killed the old king,” Arya said. “I don’t have to go with
you if I don’t want.”
Ser Meryn Trant ran out of patience. “Take her,” he said to his men. He lowered the
visor of his helm.
Three of them started forward, chainmail clinking softly with each step. Arya was

suddenly afraid. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself, to slow the racing of her
heart.
Syrio Forel stepped between them, tapping his wooden sword lightly against his boot.
“You will be stopping there. Are you men or dogs that you would threaten a child?”
“Out of the way, old man,” one of the red cloaks said.
Syrio’s stick came whistling up and rang against his helm. “I am Syrio Forel, and you will
now be speaking to me with more respect.”
“Bald bastard.” The man yanked free his longsword. The stick moved again, blindingly
fast. Arya heard a loud crack as the sword went clattering to the stone floor. “My hand,”
the guardsman yelped, cradling his broken fingers.
“You are quick, for a dancing master,” said Ser Meryn.
“You are slow, for a knight,” Syrio replied.
“Kill the Braavosi and bring me the girl,” the knight in the white armor commanded.
Four Lannister guardsmen unsheathed their swords. The fifth, with the broken fingers,
spat and pulled free a dagger with his left hand.
Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together, sliding into his water dancer’s stance, presenting
only his side to the foe. “Arya child,” he called out, never looking, never taking his eyes
off the Lannisters, “we are done with dancing for the day. Best you are going now. Run
to your father.”
Arya did not want to leave him, but he had taught her to do as he said. “Swift as a deer,”
she whispered.
“Just so,” said Syrio Forel as the Lannisters closed.
Arya retreated, her own sword stick clutched tightly in her hand. Watching him now, she
realized that Syrio had only been toying with her when they dueled. The red cloaks came
at him from three sides with steel in their hands. They had chainmail over their chest
and arms, and steel codpieces sewn into their pants, but only leather on their legs. Their
hands were bare, and the caps they wore had noseguards, but no visor over the eyes.
Syrio did not wait for them to reach him, but spun to his left. Arya had never seen a man

move as fast. He checked one sword with his stick and whirled away from a second. Off
balance, the second man lurched into the first. Syrio put a boot to his back and the red
cloaks went down together. The third guard came leaping over them, slashing at the
water dancer’s head. Syrio ducked under his blade and thrust upward. The guardsman
fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole where his left eye had been.
The fallen men were getting up. Syrio kicked one in the face and snatched the steel cap
off the other’s head. The dagger man stabbed at him. Syrio caught the thrust in the
helmet and shattered the man’s kneecap with his stick. The last red cloak shouted a
curse and charged, hacking down with both hands on his sword. Syrio rolled right, and
the butcher’s cut caught the helmetless man between neck and shoulder as he struggled
to his knees. The longsword crunched through mail and leather and flesh. The man on
his knees shrieked. Before his killer could wrench free his blade, Syrio jabbed him in the
apple of his throat. The guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back, clutching at
his neck, his face blackening.
Five men were down, dead, or dying by the time Arya reached the back door that opened
on the kitchen. She heard Ser Meryn Trant curse. “Bloody oafs,” he swore, drawing his
longsword from its scabbard.
Syrio Forel resumed his stance and clicked his teeth together. “Arya child,” he called out,
never looking at her, “be gone now.”
Look with your eyes, he had said. She saw: the knight in his pale armor head to foot,
legs, throat, and hands sheathed in metal, eyes hidden behind his high white helm, and
in his hand cruel steel. Against that: Syrio, in a leather vest, with a wooden sword in his
hand. “Syrio, run,” she screamed.
“The first sword of Braavos does not run,” he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at him. Syrio
danced away from his cut, his stick a blur. In a heartbeat, he had bounced blows off the
knight’s temple, elbow, and throat, the wood ringing against the metal of helm, gauntlet,
and gorget. Arya stood frozen. Ser Meryn advanced; Syrio backed away. He checked the
next blow, spun away from the second, deflected the third.
The fourth sliced his stick in two, splintering the wood and shearing through the lead
core.
Sobbing, Arya spun and ran.
She plunged through the kitchens and buttery, blind with panic, weaving between cooks
and potboys. A baker’s helper stepped in front of her, holding a wooden tray. Arya
bowled her over, scattering fragrant loaves of fresh-baked bread on the floor. She heard

shouting behind her as she spun around a portly butcher who stood gaping at her with a
cleaver in his hands. His arms were red to the elbow.
All that Syrio Forel had taught her went racing through her head. Swift as a deer. Quiet
as a shadow. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Quick as a snake. Calm as still water. Fear
cuts deeper than swords. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. Fear cuts deeper
than swords. The man who fears losing has already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords.
Fear cuts deeper than swords. Fear cuts deeper than swords. The grip of her wooden
sword was slick with sweat, and Arya was breathing hard when she reached the turret
stair. For an instant she froze. Up or down? Up would take her to the covered bridge that
spanned the small court to the Tower of the Hand, but that would be the way they’d
expect her to go, for certain. Never do what they expect, Syrio once said. Arya went
down, around and around, leaping over the narrow stone steps two and three at a time.
She emerged in a cavernous vaulted cellar, surrounded by casks of ale stacked twenty
feet tall. The only light came through narrow slanting windows high in the wall.
The cellar was a dead end. There was no way out but the way she had come in. She dare
not go back up those steps, but she couldn’t stay here, either. She had to find her father
and tell him what had happened. Her father would protect her.
Arya thrust her wooden sword through her belt and began to climb, leaping from cask to
cask until she could reach the window. Grasping the stone with both hands, she pulled
herself up. The wall was three feet thick, the window a tunnel slanting up and out. Arya
wriggled toward daylight. When her head reached ground level, she peered across the
bailey to the Tower of the Hand.
The stout wooden door hung splintered and broken, as if by axes. A dead man sprawled
facedown on the steps, his cloak tangled beneath him, the back of his mailed shirt
soaked red. The corpse’s cloak was grey wool trimmed with white satin, she saw with
sudden terror. She could not tell who he was.
“No,” she whispered. What was happening? Where was her father? Why had the red
cloaks come for her? She remembered what the man with the yellow beard had said, the
day she had found the monsters. If one Hand can die, why not a second? Arya felt tears
in her eyes. She held her breath to listen. She heard the sounds of fighting, shouts,
screams, the clang of steel on steel, coming through the windows of the Tower of the
Hand.
She could not go back. Her father . . .
Arya closed her eyes. For a moment she was too frightened to move. They had killed
Jory and Wyl and Heward, and that guardsman on the step, whoever he had been. They

could kill her father too, and her if they caught her. “Fear cuts deeper than swords,” she
said aloud, but it was no good pretending to be a water dancer, Syrio had been a water
dancer and the white knight had probably killed him, and anyhow she was only a little
girl with a wooden stick, alone and afraid.
She squirmed out into the yard, glancing around warily as she climbed to her feet. The
castle seemed deserted. The Red Keep was never deserted. All the people must be hiding
inside, their doors barred. Arya glanced up longingly at her bedchamber, then moved
away from the Tower of the Hand, keeping close to the wall as she slid from shadow to
shadow. She pretended she was chasing cats . . . except she was the cat now, and if they
caught her, they would kill her.
Moving between buildings and over walls, keeping stone to her back wherever possible
so no one could surprise her, Arya reached the stables almost without incident. A dozen
gold cloaks in mail and plate ran past as she was edging across the inner bailey, but
without knowing whose side they were on, she hunched down low in the shadows and let
them pass.
Hullen, who had been master of horse at Winterfell as long as Arya could remember, was
slumped on the ground by the stable door. He had been stabbed so many times it looked
as if his tunic was patterned with scarlet flowers. Arya was certain he was dead, but
when she crept closer, his eyes opened. “Arya Underfoot,” he whispered. “You
must . . . warn your . . . your lord father . . . ” Frothy red spittle bubbled from his mouth.
The master of horse closed his eyes again and said no more.
Inside were more bodies; a groom she had played with, and three of her father’s
household guard. A wagon, laden with crates and chests, stood abandoned near the door
of the stable. The dead men must have been loading it for the trip to the docks when they
were attacked. Arya snuck closer. One of the corpses was Desmond, who’d shown her his
longsword and promised to protect her father. He lay on his back, staring blindly at the
ceiling as flies crawled across his eyes. Close to him was a dead man in the red cloak and
lion-crest helm of the Lannisters. Only one, though. Every northerner is worth ten of
these southron swords, Desmond had told her. “You liar!” she said, kicking his body in a
sudden fury.
The animals were restless in their stalls, whickering and snorting at the scent of blood.
Arya’s only plan was to saddle a horse and flee, away from the castle and the city. All she
had to do was stay on the kingsroad and it would take her back to Winterfell. She took a
bridle and harness off the wall.
As she crossed in back of the wagon, a fallen chest caught her eye. It must have been
knocked down in the fight or dropped as it was being loaded. The wood had split, the lid

opening to spill the chest’s contents across the ground. Arya recognized silks and satins
and velvets she never wore. She might need warm clothes on the kingsroad,
though . . . and besides . . .
Arya knelt in the dirt among the scattered clothes. She found a heavy woolen cloak, a
velvet skirt and a silk tunic and some smallclothes, a dress her mother had embroidered
for her, a silver baby bracelet she might sell. Shoving the broken lid out of the way, she
groped inside the chest for Needle. She had hidden it way down at the bottom, under
everything, but her stuff had all been jumbled around when the chest was dropped. For a
moment Arya was afraid someone had found the sword and stolen it. Then her fingers
felt the hardness of metal under a satin gown.
“There she is,” a voice hissed close behind her.
Startled, Arya whirled. A stableboy stood behind her, a smirk on his face, his filthy white
undertunic peeking out from beneath a soiled jerkin. His boots were covered with
manure, and he had a pitchfork in one hand. “Who are you?” she asked.
“She don’t know me,” he said, “but I knows her, oh, yes. The wolf girl.”
“Help me saddle a horse,” Arya pleaded, reaching back into the chest, groping for
Needle. “My father’s the Hand of the King, he’ll reward you.”
“Father’s dead,” the boy said. He shuffled toward her. “It’s the queen who’ll be
rewarding me. Come here, girl.”
“Stay away!” Her fingers closed around Needle’s hilt.
“I says, come.” He grabbed her arm, hard.
Everything Syrio Forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat. In that instant of
sudden terror, the only lesson Arya could remember was the one Jon Snow had given
her, the very first.
She stuck him with the pointy end, driving the blade upward with a wild, hysterical
strength.
Needle went through his leather jerkin and the white flesh of his belly and came out
between his shoulder blades. The boy dropped the pitchfork and made a soft noise,
something between a gasp and a sigh. His hands closed around the blade. “Oh, gods,” he
moaned, as his undertunic began to redden. “Take it out.”

When she took it out, he died.
The horses were screaming. Arya stood over the body, still and frightened in the face of
death. Blood had gushed from the boy’s mouth as he collapsed, and more was seeping
from the slit in his belly, pooling beneath his body. His palms were cut where he’d
grabbed at the blade. She backed away slowly, Needle red in her hand. She had to get
away, someplace far from here, someplace safe away from the stableboy’s accusing eyes.
She snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to her mare, but as she lifted the
saddle to the horse’s back, Arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the castle gates
would be closed. Even the postern doors would likely be guarded. Maybe the guards
wouldn’t recognize her. If they thought she was a boy, perhaps they’d let her . . . no,
they’d have orders not to let anyone out, it wouldn’t matter whether they knew her or
not.
But there was another way out of the castle . . .
The saddle slipped from Arya’s fingers and fell to the dirt with a thump and a puff of
dust. Could she find the room with the monsters again? She wasn’t certain, yet she knew
she had to try.
She found the clothing she’d gathered and slipped into the cloak, concealing Needle
beneath its folds. The rest of her things she tied in a roll. With the bundle under her arm,
she crept to the far end of the stable. Unlatching the back door, she peeked out
anxiously. She could hear the distant sound of swordplay, and the shivery wail of a man
screaming in pain across the bailey. She would need to go down the serpentine steps,
past the small kitchen and the pig yard, that was how she’d gone last time, chasing the
black tomcat . . . only that would take her right past the barracks of the gold cloaks. She
couldn’t go that way. Arya tried to think of another way. If she crossed to the other side
of the castle, she could creep along the river wall and through the little godswood . . . but
first she’d have to cross the yard, in the plain view of the guards on the walls.
She had never seen so many men on the walls. Gold cloaks, most of them, armed with
spears. Some of them knew her by sight. What would they do if they saw her running
across the yard? She’d look so small from up there, would they be able to tell who she
was? Would they care?
She had to leave now, she told herself, but when the moment came, she was too
frightened to move.
Calm as still water, a small voice whispered in her ear. Arya was so startled she almost
dropped her bundle. She looked around wildly, but there was no one in the stable but

her, and the horses, and the dead men.
Quiet as a shadow, she heard. Was it her own voice, or Syrio’s? She could not tell, yet
somehow it calmed her fears.
She stepped out of the stable.
It was the scariest thing she’d ever done. She wanted to run and hide, but she made
herself walk across the yard, slowly, putting one foot in front of the other as if she had
all the time in the world and no reason to be afraid of anyone. She thought she could feel
their eyes, like bugs crawling on her skin under her clothes. Arya never looked up. If she
saw them watching, all her courage would desert her, she knew, and she would drop the
bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby, and then they would have her. She kept
her gaze on the ground. By the time she reached the shadow of the royal sept on the far
side of the yard, Arya was cold with sweat, but no one had raised the hue and cry.
The sept was open and empty. Inside, half a hundred prayer candles burned in a fragrant
silence. Arya figured the gods would never miss two. She stuffed them up her sleeves,
and left by a back window. Sneaking back to the alley where she had cornered the oneeared tom was easy, but after that she got lost. She crawled in and out of windows,
hopped over walls, and felt her way through dark cellars, quiet as a shadow. Once she
heard a woman weeping. It took her more than an hour to find the low narrow window
that slanted down to the dungeon where the monsters waited.
She tossed her bundle through and doubled back to light her candle. That was chancy;
the fire she’d remembered seeing had burnt down to embers, and she heard voices as
she was blowing on the coals. Cupping her fingers around the flickering candle, she went
out the window as they were coming in the door, without ever getting a glimpse of who it
was.
This time the monsters did not frighten her. They seemed almost old friends. Arya held
the candle over her head. With each step she took, the shadows moved against the walls,
as if they were turning to watch her pass. “Dragons,” she whispered. She slid Needle out
from under her cloak. The slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big, yet
somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand.
The long windowless hall beyond the door was as black as she remembered. She held
Needle in her left hand, her sword hand, the candle in her right fist. Hot wax ran down
across her knuckles. The entrance to the well had been to the left, so Arya went right.
Part of her wanted to run, but she was afraid of snuffing out her candle. She heard the
faint squeaking of rats and glimpsed a pair of tiny glowing eyes on the edge of the light,
but rats did not scare her. Other things did. It would be so easy to hide here, as she had

hidden from the wizard and the man with the forked beard. She could almost see the
stableboy standing against the wall, his hands curled into claws with the blood still
dripping from the deep gashes in his palms where Needle had cut him. He might be
waiting to grab her as she passed. He would see her candle coming a long way off. Maybe
she would be better off without the light . . .
Fear cuts deeper than swords, the quiet voice inside her whispered. Suddenly Arya
remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told
herself. She’d been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother Robb had
taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who’d been no bigger than Rickon was
now. They’d only had one candle between them, and Bran’s eyes had gotten as big as
saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter, with their wolves at their
feet and their iron swords across their laps.
Robb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and
Lyanna, to show them their own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle,
anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had told her there were spiders down here, and
rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. “There are worse things than
spiders and rats,” he whispered. “This is where the dead walk.” That was when they
heard the sound, low and deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya’s hand.
When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa
ran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb’s leg, sobbing. Arya
stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. “You
stupid,” she told him, “you scared the baby,” but Jon and Robb just laughed and
laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too.
The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her.
The stableboy was dead, she’d killed him, and if he jumped out at her she’d kill him
again. She was going home. Everything would be better once she was home again, safe
behind Winterfell’s grey granite walls.
Her footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead of her as Arya plunged deeper into the
darkness.

SANSA
They came for Sansa on the third day.
She chose a simple dress of dark grey wool, plainly cut but richly embroidered around
the collar and sleeves. Her fingers felt thick and clumsy as she struggled with the silver
fastenings without the benefit of servants. Jeyne Poole had been confined with her, but
Jeyne was useless. Her face was puffy from all her crying, and she could not seem to stop
sobbing about her father.
“I’m certain your father is well,” Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress
buttoned right. “I’ll ask the queen to let you see him.” She thought that kindness might
lift Jeyne’s spirits, but the other girl just looked at her with red, swollen eyes and began
to cry all the harder. She was such a child.
Sansa had wept too, the first day. Even within the stout walls of Maegor’s Holdfast, with
her door closed and barred, it was hard not to be terrified when the killing began. She
had grown up to the sound of steel in the yard, and scarcely a day of her life had passed
without hearing the clash of sword on sword, yet somehow knowing that the fighting was
real made all the difference in the world. She heard it as she had never heard it before,
and there were other sounds as well, grunts of pain, angry curses, shouts for help, and
the moans of wounded and dying men. In the songs, the knights never screamed nor
begged for mercy.
So she wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening, calling
for her father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince. If the men
guarding her heard her pleas, they gave no answer. The only time the door opened was
late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside, bruised and shaking. “They’re
killing everyone,” the steward’s daughter had shrieked at her. She went on and on. The
Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer, she said. There were bodies on
the stair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were slick with blood. Sansa dried her
own tears as she struggled to comfort her friend. They went to sleep in the same bed,
cradled in each other’s arms like sisters.
The second day was even worse. The room where Sansa had been confined was at the
top of the highest tower of Maegor’s Holdfast. From its window, she could see that the
heavy iron portcullis in the gatehouse was down, and the drawbridge drawn up over the

deep dry moat that separated the keep-within-a-keep from the larger castle that
surrounded it. Lannister guardsmen prowled the walls with spears and crossbows to
hand. The fighting was over, and the silence of the grave had settled over the Red Keep.
The only sounds were Jeyne Poole’s endless whimpers and sobs.
They were fed—hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break their fast, roast
chicken and greens at midday, and a late supper of beef and barley stew—but the
servants who brought the meals would not answer Sansa’s questions. That evening,
some women brought her clothes from the Tower of the Hand, and some of Jeyne’s
things as well, but they seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne, and when she tried to talk
to them, they fled from her as if she had the grey plague. The guards outside the door
still refused to let them leave the room.
“Please, I need to speak to the queen again,” Sansa told them, as she told everyone she
saw that day. “She’ll want to talk to me, I know she will. Tell her I want to see her,
please. If not the queen, then Prince Joffrey, if you’d be so kind. We’re to marry when
we’re older.”
At sunset on the second day, a great bell began to ring. Its voice was deep and sonorous,
and the long slow clanging filled Sansa with a sense of dread. The ringing went on and
on, and after a while they heard other bells answering from the Great Sept of Baelor on
Visenya’s Hill. The sound rumbled across the city like thunder, warning of the storm to
come.
“What is it?” Jeyne asked, covering her ears. “Why are they ringing the bells?”
“The king is dead.” Sansa could not say how she knew it, yet she did. The slow, endless
clanging filled their room, as mournful as a dirge. Had some enemy stormed the castle
and murdered King Robert? Was that the meaning of the fighting they had heard?
She went to sleep wondering, restless, and fearful. Was her beautiful Joffrey the king
now? Or had they killed him too? She was afraid for him, and for her father. If only they
would tell her what was happening . . .
That night Sansa dreamt of Joffrey on the throne, with herself seated beside him in a
gown of woven gold. She had a crown on her head, and everyone she had ever known
came before her, to bend the knee and say their courtesies.
The next morning, the morning of the third day, Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard
came to escort her to the queen.
Ser Boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. His nose was flat,

his cheeks baggy with jowls, his hair grey and brittle. Today he wore white velvet, and
his snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch. The beast had the soft sheen of gold,
and his eyes were tiny rubies. “You look very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser
Boros,” Sansa told him. A lady remembered her courtesies, and she was resolved to be a
lady no matter what.
“And you, my lady,” Ser Boros said in a flat voice. “Her Grace awaits. Come with me.”
There were guards outside her door, Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lioncrested helms. Sansa made herself smile at them pleasantly and bid them a good
morning as she passed. It was the first time she had been allowed outside the chamber
since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings past. “To keep you safe, my
sweet one,” Queen Cersei had told her. “Joffrey would never forgive me if anything
happened to his precious.”
Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments, but instead
he led her out of Maegor’s Holdfast. The bridge was down again. Some workmen were
lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat. When Sansa peered down, she
saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below. She averted her eyes quickly, afraid
to ask, afraid to look too long, afraid he might be someone she knew.
They found Queen Cersei in the council chambers, seated at the head of a long table
littered with papers, candles, and blocks of sealing wax. The room was as splendid as any
that Sansa had ever seen. She stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin
sphinxes that sat beside the door.
“Your Grace,” Ser Boros said when they were ushered inside by another of the
Kingsguard, Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face, “I’ve brought the girl.”
Sansa had hoped Joffrey might be with her. Her prince was not there, but three of the
king’s councillors were. Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen’s left hand, Grand Maester
Pycelle at the end of the table, while Lord Varys hovered over them, smelling flowery. All
of them were clad in black, she realized with a feeling of dread. Mourning clothes . . .
The queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn
into her bodice, covering her from neck to bosom. They were cut in the shape of
teardrops, as if the queen were weeping blood. Cersei smiled to see her, and Sansa
thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen. “Sansa, my sweet
child,” she said, “I know you’ve been asking for me. I’m sorry that I could not send for
you sooner. Matters have been very unsettled, and I have not had a moment. I trust my
people have been taking good care of you?”

“Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant, Your Grace, thank you ever so much for
asking,” Sansa said politely. “Only, well, no one will talk to us or tell us what’s
happened . . . ”
“Us?” Cersei seemed puzzled.
“We put the steward’s girl in with her,” Ser Boros said. “We did not know what else to do
with her.”
The queen frowned. “Next time, you will ask,” she said, her voice sharp. “The gods only
know what sort of tales she’s been filling Sansa’s head with.”
“Jeyne’s scared,” Sansa said. “She won’t stop crying. I promised her I’d ask if she could
see her father.”
Old Grand Maester Pycelle lowered his eyes.
“Her father is well, isn’t he?” Sansa said anxiously. She knew there had been fighting,
but surely no one would harm a steward. Vayon Poole did not even wear a sword.
Queen Cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn. “I won’t have Sansa fretting
needlessly. What shall we do with this little friend of hers, my lords?”
Lord Petyr leaned forward. “I’ll find a place for her.”
“Not in the city,” said the queen.
“Do you take me for a fool?”
The queen ignored that. “Ser Boros, escort this girl to Lord Petyr’s apartments and
instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her. Tell her that Littlefinger will
be taking her to see her father, that ought to calm her down. I want her gone before
Sansa returns to her chamber.”
“As you command, Your Grace,” Ser Boros said. He bowed deeply, spun on his heel, and
took his leave, his long white cloak stirring the air behind him.
Sansa was confused. “I don’t understand,” she said. “Where is Jeyne’s father? Why can’t
Ser Boros take her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it?” She had promised
herself she would be a lady, gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother, the Lady
Catelyn, but all of a sudden she was scared again. For a second she thought she might

cry. “Where are you sending her? She hasn’t done anything wrong, she’s a good girl.”
“She’s upset you,” the queen said gently. “We can’t be having that. Not another word,
now. Lord Baelish will see that Jeyne’s well taken care of, I promise you.” She patted the
chair beside her. “Sit down, Sansa. I want to talk to you.”
Sansa seated herself beside the queen. Cersei smiled again, but that did not make her
feel any less anxious. Varys was wringing his soft hands together, Grand Maester Pycelle
kept his sleepy eyes on the papers in front of him, but she could feel Littlefinger staring.
Something about the way the small man looked at her made Sansa feel as though she
had no clothes on. Goose bumps pimpled her skin.
“Sweet Sansa,” Queen Cersei said, laying a soft hand on her wrist. “Such a beautiful
child. I do hope you know how much Joffrey and I love you.”
“You do?” Sansa said, breathless. Littlefinger was forgotten. Her prince loved her.
Nothing else mattered.
The queen smiled. “I think of you almost as my own daughter. And I know the love you
bear for Joffrey.” She gave a weary shake of her head. “I am afraid we have some grave
news about your lord father. You must be brave, child.”
Her quiet words gave Sansa a chill. “What is it?”
“Your father is a traitor, dear,” Lord Varys said.
Grand Maester Pycelle lifted his ancient head. “With my own ears, I heard Lord Eddard
swear to our beloved King Robert that he would protect the young princes as if they were
his own sons. And yet the moment the king was dead, he called the small council
together to steal Prince Joffrey’s rightful throne.”
“No,” Sansa blurted. “He wouldn’t do that. He wouldn’t!”
The queen picked up a letter. The paper was torn and stiff with dried blood, but the
broken seal was her father’s, the direwolf stamped in pale wax. “We found this on the
captain of your household guard, Sansa. It is a letter to my late husband’s brother
Stannis, inviting him to take the crown.”
“Please, Your Grace, there’s been a mistake.” Sudden panic made her dizzy and faint.
“Please, send for my father, he’ll tell you, he would never write such a letter, the king was
his friend.”

“Robert thought so,” said the queen. “This betrayal would have broken his heart. The
gods are kind, that he did not live to see it.” She sighed. “Sansa, sweetling, you must see
what a dreadful position this has left us in. You are innocent of any wrong, we all know
that, and yet you are the daughter of a traitor. How can I allow you to marry my son?”
“But I love him,” Sansa wailed, confused and frightened. What did they mean to do to
her? What had they done to her father? It was not supposed to happen this way. She had
to wed Joffrey, they were betrothed, he was promised to her, she had even dreamed
about it. It wasn’t fair to take him away from her on account of whatever her father
might have done.
“How well I know that, child,” Cersei said, her voice so kind and sweet. “Why else should
you have come to me and told me of your father’s plan to send you away from us, if not
for love?”
“It was for love,” Sansa said in a rush. “Father wouldn’t even give me leave to say
farewell.” She was the good girl, the obedient girl, but she had felt as wicked as Arya that
morning, sneaking away from Septa Mordane, defying her lord father. She had never
done anything so willful before, and she would never have done it then if she hadn’t
loved Joffrey as much as she did. “He was going to take me back to Winterfell and marry
me to some hedge knight, even though it was Joff I wanted. I told him, but he wouldn’t
listen.” The king had been her last hope. The king could command Father to let her stay
in King’s Landing and marry Prince Joffrey, Sansa knew he could, but the king had
always frightened her. He was loud and rough-voiced and drunk as often as not, and he
would probably have just sent her back to Lord Eddard, if they even let her see him. So
she went to the queen instead, and poured out her heart, and Cersei had listened and
thanked her sweetly . . . only then Ser Arys had escorted her to the high room in
Maegor’s Holdfast and posted guards, and a few hours later, the fighting had begun
outside. “Please,” she finished, “you have to let me marry Joffrey, I’ll be ever so good a
wife to him, you’ll see. I’ll be a queen just like you, I promise.”
Queen Cersei looked to the others. “My lords of the council, what do you say to her plea?”
“The poor child,” murmured Varys. “A love so true and innocent, Your Grace, it would be
cruel to deny it . . . and yet, what can we do? Her father stands condemned.” His soft
hands washed each other in a gesture of helpless distress.
“A child born of traitor’s seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her,” said Grand
Maester Pycelle. “She is a sweet thing now, but in ten years, who can say what treasons
she may hatch?”
“No,” Sansa said, horrified. “I’m not, I’d never . . . I wouldn’t betray Joffrey, I love him, I

swear it, I do.”
“Oh, so poignant,” said Varys. “And yet, it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths.”
“She reminds me of the mother, not the father,” Lord Petyr Baelish said quietly. “Look at
her. The hair, the eyes. She is the very image of Cat at the same age.”
The queen looked at her, troubled, and yet Sansa could see kindness in her clear green
eyes. “Child,” she said, “if I could truly believe that you were not like your father, why
nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey. I know he loves you
with all his heart.” She sighed. “And yet, I fear that Lord Varys and the Grand Maester
have the right of it. The blood will tell. I have only to remember how your sister set her
wolf on my son.”
“I’m not like Arya,” Sansa blurted. “She has the traitor’s blood, not me. I’m good, ask
Septa Mordane, she’ll tell you, I only want to be Joffrey’s loyal and loving wife.”
She felt the weight of Cersei’s eyes as the queen studied her face. “I believe you mean it,
child.” She turned to face the others. “My lords, it seems to me that if the rest of her kin
were to remain loyal in this terrible time, that would go a long way toward laying our
fears to rest.”
Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his huge soft beard, his wide brow furrowed in thought.
“Lord Eddard has three sons.”
“Mere boys,” Lord Petyr said with a shrug. “I should be more concerned with Lady
Catelyn and the Tullys.”
The queen took Sansa’s hand in both of hers. “Child, do you know your letters?”
Sansa nodded nervously. She could read and write better than any of her brothers,
although she was hopeless at sums.
“I am pleased to hear that. Perhaps there is hope for you and Joffrey still . . . ”
“What do you want me to do?”
“You must write your lady mother, and your brother, the eldest . . . what is his name?”
“Robb,” Sansa said.

“The word of your lord father’s treason will no doubt reach them soon. Better that it
should come from you. You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his king.”
Sansa wanted Joffrey desperately, but she did not think she had the courage to do as the
queen was asking. “But he never . . . I don’t . . . Your Grace, I wouldn’t know what to say
...”
The queen patted her hand. “We will tell you what to write, child. The important thing is
that you urge Lady Catelyn and your brother to keep the king’s peace.”
“It will go hard for them if they don’t,” said Grand Maester Pycelle. “By the love you bear
them, you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom.”
“Your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully,” the queen said. “You must tell
her that you are well and in our care, that we are treating you gently and seeing to your
every want. Bid them to come to King’s Landing and pledge their fealty to Joffrey when
he takes his throne. If they do that . . . why, then we shall know that there is no taint in
your blood, and when you come into the flower of your womanhood, you shall wed the
king in the Great Sept of Baelor, before the eyes of gods and men.”
. . . wed the king . . . The words made her breath come faster, yet still Sansa hesitated.
“Perhaps . . . if I might see my father, talk to him about . . . ”
“Treason?” Lord Varys hinted.
“You disappoint me, Sansa,” the queen said, with eyes gone hard as stones. “We’ve told
you of your father’s crimes. If you are truly as loyal as you say, why should you want to
see him?”
“I . . . I only meant . . . ” Sansa felt her eyes grow wet. “He’s not . . . please, he hasn’t
been . . . hurt, or . . . or . . . ”
“Lord Eddard has not been harmed,” the queen said.
“But . . . what’s to become of him?”
“That is a matter for the king to decide,” Grand Maester Pycelle announced ponderously.
The king! Sansa blinked back her tears. Joffrey was the king now, she thought. Her
gallant prince would never hurt her father, no matter what he might have done. If she
went to him and pleaded for mercy, she was certain he’d listen. He had to listen, he
loved her, even the queen said so. Joff would need to punish Father, the lords would

expect it, but perhaps he could send him back to Winterfell, or exile him to one of the
Free Cities across the narrow sea. It would only have to be for a few years. By then she
and Joffrey would be married. Once she was queen, she could persuade Joff to bring
Father back and grant him a pardon.
Only . . . if Mother or Robb did anything treasonous, called the banners or refused to
swear fealty or anything, it would all go wrong. Her Joffrey was good and kind, she
knew it in her heart, but a king had to be stern with rebels. She had to make them
understand, she had to!
“I’ll . . . I’ll write the letters,” Sansa told them.
With a smile as warm as the sunrise, Cersei Lannister leaned close and kissed her gently
on the cheek. “I knew you would. Joffrey will be so proud when I tell him what courage
and good sense you’ve shown here today.”
In the end, she wrote four letters. To her mother, the Lady Catelyn Stark, and to her
brothers at Winterfell, and to her aunt and her grandfather as well, Lady Lysa Arryn of
the Eyrie, and Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun. By the time she had done, her fingers were
cramped and stiff and stained with ink. Varys had her father’s seal. She warmed the pale
white beeswax over a candle, poured it carefully, and watched as the eunuch stamped
each letter with the direwolf of House Stark.
Jeyne Poole and all her things were gone when Ser Mandon Moore returned Sansa to the
high tower of Maegor’s Holdfast. No more weeping, she thought gratefully. Yet somehow
it seemed colder with Jeyne gone, even after she’d built a fire. She pulled a chair close to
the hearth, took down one of her favorite books, and lost herself in the stories of Florian
and Jonquil, of Lady Shella and the Rainbow Knight, of valiant Prince Aemon and his
doomed love for his brother’s queen.
It was not until later that night, as she was drifting off to sleep, that Sansa realized she
had forgotten to ask about her sister.

JON
Othor,” announced Ser Jaremy Rykker, “beyond a doubt. And this one was Jafer
Flowers.” He turned the corpse over with his foot, and the dead white face stared up at
the overcast sky with blue, blue eyes. “They were Ben Stark’s men, both of them.”
My uncle’s men, Jon thought numbly. He remembered how he’d pleaded to ride with
them. Gods, I was such a green boy. If he had taken me, it might be me lying here . . .
Jafer’s right wrist ended in the ruin of torn flesh and splintered bone left by Ghost’s
jaws. His right hand was floating in a jar of vinegar back in Maester Aemon’s tower. His
left hand, still at the end of his arm, was as black as his cloak.
“Gods have mercy,” the Old Bear muttered. He swung down from his garron, handing
his reins to Jon. The morning was unnaturally warm; beads of sweat dotted the Lord
Commander’s broad forehead like dew on a melon. His horse was nervous, rolling her
eyes, backing away from the dead men as far as her lead would allow. Jon led her off a
few paces, fighting to keep her from bolting. The horses did not like the feel of this place.
For that matter, neither did Jon.
The dogs liked it least of all. Ghost had led the party here; the pack of hounds had been
useless. When Bass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the
severed hand, they had gone wild, yowling and barking, fighting to get away. Even now
they were snarling and whimpering by turns, pulling at their leashes while Chett cursed
them for curs.
It is only a wood, Jon told himself, and they’re only dead men. He had seen dead men
before . . .
Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty
castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had
gone further than before. In the dark he’d heard the scrape of stone on stone. When he
turned he saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came
stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart
hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not
shake his deep sense of terror. He dared not go back to sleep. Instead he had climbed the
Wall and walked, restless, until he saw the light of the dawn off to the cast. It was only a

dream. I am a brother of the Night’s Watch now, not a frightened boy.
Samwell Tarly huddled beneath the trees, half-hidden behind the horses. His round fat
face was the color of curdled milk. So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch,
but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either. “I can’t look,” he whispered
miserably.
“You have to look,” Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would not hear.
“Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn’t he? What good are eyes if they’re shut?”
“Yes, but . . . I’m such a coward, Jon.”
Jon put a hand on Sam’s shoulder. “We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even
Ghost. No one will hurt you, Sam. Go ahead and look. The first look is the hardest.”
Sam gave a tremulous nod, working up his courage with a visible effort. Slowly he
swiveled his head. His eyes widened, but Jon held his arm so he could not turn away.
“Ser Jaremy,” the Old Bear asked gruffly, “Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode
from the Wall. Where are the others?”
Ser Jaremy shook his head. “Would that I knew.”
Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer. “Two of our brothers butchered
almost within sight of the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw nothing. Is this
what the Night’s Watch has fallen to? Do we still sweep these woods?”
“Yes, my lord, but—”
“Do we still mount watches?”
“We do, but—”
“This man wears a hunting horn.” Mormont pointed at Othor. “Must I suppose that he
died without sounding it? Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?”
Ser Jaremy bristled, his face taut with anger. “No horn was blown, my lord, or my
rangers would have heard it. I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I
should like . . . and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were
wont to do before, by your own command.”

The Old Bear grunted. “Yes. Well. Be that as it may.” He made an impatient gesture.
“Tell me how they died.”
Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers, Ser Jaremy grasped his
head by the scalp. The hair came out between his fingers, brittle as straw. The knight
cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand. A great gash in the side of the
corpse’s neck opened like a mouth, crusted with dried blood. Only a few ropes of pale
tendon still attached the head to the neck. “This was done with an axe.”
“Aye,” muttered Dywen, the old forester. “Belike the axe that Othor carried, m’lord.”
Jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly, but he pressed his lips together and
made himself look at the second body. Othor had been a big ugly man, and he made a
big ugly corpse. No axe was in evidence. Jon remembered Othor; he had been the one
bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out. His singing days were done. His flesh
was blanched white as milk, everywhere but his hands. His hands were black like Jafer’s.
Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a
rash, breast and groin and throat. Yet his eyes were still open. They stared up at the sky,
blue as sapphires.
Ser Jaremy stood. “The wildlings have axes too.”
Mormont rounded on him. “So you believe this is Mance Rayder’s work? This close to
the Wall?”
“Who else, my lord?”
Jon could have told him. He knew, they all knew, yet no man of them would say the
words. The Others are only a story, a tale to make children shiver. If they ever lived at
all, they are gone eight thousand years. Even the thought made him feel foolish; he was
a man grown now, a black brother of the Night’s Watch, not the boy who’d once sat at
Old Nan’s feet with Bran and Robb and Arya.
